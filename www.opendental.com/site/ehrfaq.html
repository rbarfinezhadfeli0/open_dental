<p><b>What is Modified Stage 2?</b></p>
<p>On October 7, 2015, CMS released a new Final Rule that made the reporting requirements for meaningful use easier for 2015 through 2017. CMS then released another Final Rule on 8/02/2017 extending the ability to report for Modified Stage 2 through 2018. See <a href="ehrmodified2.html">Modified Stage 2</a></p>
<p><b>What is the difference between Participation Year, Meaningful Use (MU) Year and Stage of MU?</b></p>
<p class="MarginBottomZero">CMS uses each term to identify a progression through the EHR Incentive Program. </p>
<ul class="MarginBottomGap">
<li>Incentive Payment Year/Participation Year: Corresponds to the number of years you have received an incentive payment. For Medicare, the years must be consecutive and the participation year will match the year of MU. For Medicaid, the years do not need to be consecutive. The participation year usually differs from the MU year by 1 since most providers choose to Adopt, Implement or Upgrade in year 1.</li>
<li>Year of MU: Corresponds to the number of years you have demonstrated meaningful use of a certified EHR software for a reporting period.</li>
<li>Stage of MU: Refers to the MU criteria that must be met in a participation year. Prior to October 2015, providers typically demonstrated criteria for each stage for two years, then move to the next stage. As of October 2015, there is was a single set of criteria for all providers called Modified Stage 2. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>What is an Objective / Measure?</b></p>
<p>In Modified Stage 2, there is a single set of 10 objectives. Within each objective is a measure (or measures) that a provider must satisfy to demonstrate meaningful use. Some measures have an exclusion that a provider may or may not qualify for. In addition, providers must report on <a href="../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl=%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7ehrcqm.html">EHR Clinical Quality Measures</a>. Open Dental calculates 9 CQMs.</p>
<p><b>What is a Reporting Period?</b></p>
<p>The period of time for which an Eligible Professional (EP) must demonstrate meaningful use of a certified EHR software. The duration of the reporting period depends on your incentive payment year.</p>
