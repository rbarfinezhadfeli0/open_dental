<p>Image conversions take the images and documents stored in your current software and place them in Open Dental. Most of the image conversions listed below only convert documents and scanned images. There are only a couple of image conversions listed below that convert x-rays. You can speak with a member of the Open Dental Conversion Department if you have specific questions about what types of images will convert from your current software.</p>
<p>A conversion of scanned documents is distinct from imaging software (usually for radiography or x-rays, intraoral imaging etc.) See <a href="programbridges.html">Program Bridges</a> for more information. </p>
<p class="MarginBottomZero">Converting scanned documents and patient pictures is different than a data <a href="conversions.html"> Conversion</a> and incurs a separate fee. </p>
<ul class="MarginBottomGap">
<li> Fees vary depending on the complexity of the conversion and quality of images.</li>
</ul>
<p class="MarginBottomZero">Converting X-Rays is different than a scanned document and patient picture image conversion and incurs a separate fee. </p>
<ul class="MarginBottomGap">
<li> Fees vary depending on the complexity of the conversion and size of x-ray image directory.</li>
</ul>
<p class="MarginBottomZero">The "Normal Charge" cost is for image directories that are less than 500GB in size. </p>
<ul class="MarginBottomGap">
<li>Most image conversions cost $800, most dental offices have less than 500GB of images, so $800 is the image conversion charge 95% of the time but there are a few exceptions. </li>
</ul>
<p>Below is a list applications and estimated image conversion fees. If your application is not listed, we still may be able to convert, so please ask us. We are constantly looking for new ways to convert scanned documents, patient pictures, and x-rays. <br></p>
