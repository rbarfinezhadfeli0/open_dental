<p>Open Dental can modify an existing <a href="https://opendentalsoft.com:1943/ODQueryList/QueryList.aspx">Query Example</a> or previous query request or write a custom query for customers currently on support. </p>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p><p><b>When will I be charged?</b></p>
 The charge is applied once the query has been written and delivered. We will not proceed with writing the request until we have received explicit, written approval of the estimated cost.</p>
<p><p><b>Can I get a custom query if I'm not on support?</b></p>
 No, you must be on support for the duration of the query request process.</p>
<p><p><b>What does expediting do?</b></p>
 Expedited processing ensures the query is the first in line for processing. We cannot guarantee we will be able to meet any given deadline, and deadlines that are less than a month out are extremely unlikely to be met. We strongly recommend expediting the query request if you have a deadline to meet, and submitting the request as soon as you know what the deadline is to ensure delivery is as close to the deadline as possible.</p>
<p><p><b>Is there a charge for changing the query?</b></p>
 This depends on the complexity of the requested changes. We will need to call you to thoroughly discuss these changes, then provide a new cost estimate.</p>
<p><p><b>I updated Open Dental and now my query doesn't work. Can you fix it?</b></p>
 Sometimes our engineers make changes to the code that defines how data is organized in the database that cause older queries to no longer run. Since queries are written specifically for the version you are on at the time of the request, a new request is needed to write the query for a different version. <p><p><b>How do I cancel my request?</b></p>
</p>
 Call our support line or email the Query Team at <i>queries@opendental.com</i>. Make sure to reference the number of the request you wish to cancel. Please note that queries cannot be cancelled once the writing process has begun.</p>
<p><p><b>Can I reopen a cancelled request?</b></p>
 Yes! Call our support line or email the Query Team at <i>queries@opendental.com</i>. Make sure to reference the number of the request you wish to reopen. </p>
<p><b>I have a query that wasn't written by Open Dental. Can you help me with it?</b></p>
<p>No. We cannot modify queries that were written outside of our organization.</p>
<p><p><b>Other issues or questions?</b></p>
 For all other issues, please call our support line or send an email to the Query Team at <i>queries@opendental.com</i>.</p>
<h2>Submitting a Query Request</h2>
<p>To get started, fill out a <a href="https://opendentalsoft.com:1943/ODQueryRequest/QueryRequestForm.aspx">Custom Query Request Form</a>.</p>
<p>Due to the overwhelming demand for custom queries, we currently have a backlog of requests. It may take several weeks to process and write a custom query. More complex queries may be split into multiple queries, or in some cases, denied.</p>
<p class="MarginBottomZero">If you need a request sooner, or the request was denied, consider alternate options:  </p>
