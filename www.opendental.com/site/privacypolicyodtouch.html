<p>Last updated 04/18/2023</p>
<p>ODTouch is a commercial application for use in dental offices that are also using <a href="https://opendental.com/">Open Dental Software</a>, a dental practice management software. Staff and patients of the dental office (hereafter the 'Customer') interact with the ODTouch application, and data is securely transmitted to the office's database by Open Dental servers. Signup for the paid ODTouch service can be completed from inside Open Dental Software, and is separate from the free ODTouch application.</p>
<p>This document informs Customers about how we collect, use, and disclose personal information with exclusive regard to this application.</p>
<p>Patient data is collected but not retained in the application. It is transmitted in live time, in encrypted form, from the device to the Customer database. This data is not collected or used by us. The Customer verifies each device once, using office level credentials previously created during the signup process. Upon each use, the Customer provides user level information verified against that Customer's database.</p>
<p>We do not include a policy here about how we secure data 'at rest', because we do not collect or store it separately from the Customer's database. It is the responsibility of the customer, and/or other entity that might be hosting that database, to secure it and the network upon which it resides.</p>
<p>We secure patient data 'in transit' as detailed here: <a href="encryption.html">Encryption of Data at Rest and in Transit</a>, under the heading eConnector.</p>
<p>We may occasionally, (as requested by and as an agent of the Customer), review or interact with data provided by the Customer, in the course of support provided by us. Anytime the Customer provides us access to patient data, it should follow local privacy laws. In the United States of America this includes <a href="hipaaopendental.html">HIPAA</a>, and in Europe this includes <a href="gdpr.html">GDPR</a>.</p>
<p>Updates to this policy will occur as needed to accommodate new technologies, industry practices, and regulatory requirements. We recommend that you review this page periodically for any changes. Changes made to this page are effective immediately after they are posted.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding our Privacy Policy, please do not hesitate to contact us. See our <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> page for hours of operation and contact options.</p>
<p>'We' or 'Us' in this policy refers to Open Dental Software, Inc., 3275 Marietta St SE Salem, OR 97317, United States. </p>
