        <Description>1 patient. 1 insplan, 6 benefits: 1000 annual max, 100% preventive, 100% diagnostic, $50 deduct general, $25 deduct preventive, and $25 deduct diagnostic. One TP procedure for $60, code D0120 (perExam). Second TP procedure for $70, code D1110 (prophy). Second procedure should show no deductible. This is because we need to treat the $25 deductible as a single deductible that applies to preventive/diagnostic. It's not two deductibles. This is only a temporary solution, and the better solution will be to support code ranges that include both preventive and diagnostic, and then to enter a single $25 deductible for that range.</Description>

The patient has one insurance plan, category percentage, subscriber self. Benefits: annual max $1300, 50% coverage on crowns, and a $25 general deductible. Both TP procs are crowns, first TP proc is D2790  for $800 on #1 with priority 1, second TP proc is D2790 on #9 for $800 with priority 2. First, the estimates are pre-calculated by visiting the TP module. Then, when opening a procedure from Chart Module, followed by opening the claimproc from inside of the Edit Procedure window, the amounts must match those listed in the table above.

        <Description>The patient has one insurance plan with general deductible of $50, 100% coverage on Diagnostic, and a $10 xray deductible. We treatment plan the patient for a cleaning (D0110) and an xray (D0220). The cleaning is estimated to take up $40 of the patient's deductible and the xray is estimated to take up $10 of the patient's deductible. We mark the cleaning complete and leave the xray treatment planned. A claim for the cleaning is submitted, and the deductible comes out to $50. This means that, even though the patient has a $10 xray deductible,they have already hit their max deductible for the year and should owe nothing. The xray deductible estimate is $0.</Description>

We treatment plan the patient for two xrays (D0330 and D0220). The estimate is calculated and shows that we expect the patient to pay $25 for one xray and $25 for another, hitting their xray deductible. We set one xray complete and create a claim which will require  the patient pay their max xray deductible of $50. Finally, we treatment plan a cleaning procedure, complete it, and submit a claim. The deductible comes out to $50. This means that this $50 that went towards their xray deductible also goes towards their general deductible. XRay: &#x09; $50 deductible&#x09;&#x09;-&#x09; $50 patient portion paid &#x09; = &#x09; $0 owed for patient's other xray General:&#x09; $100 deductible &#x09;-&#x09; $50 xray deductible met &#x09; = &#x09; $50 owed for the patient's general deductible</Description>

All payment plan charges are attached to a procedure that is worth $200. The first month of payment plan charges due will be $10.94 of which $9.27 is principal and $1.67 is interest. The patient will make a payment of $30.94 which overpays the current amount due by $20. The payment will be made with two payment splits, one for the $9.27 in principal and one for $21.67 in interest. Running an income transfer after creating the payment should move the $20 of overpaid interest to unearned and then from unearned directly to the procedure because the payment plan does not cover the entire procedure amount.</Description>

        <Description>When a user creates a Dynamic Payment Plan, with attached production, payments can be made Explicitly or Implicitly linked to either one or both. In the event that the user wishes to create offsetting payments that do not Explicitly link to production, we want to be certain the Dynamic Payment Plan is not overpaid. We also do not want to allow money to be taken directly from production. If a user creates a Dynamic Payment Plan for Patient Joe, giving the plan a 5 APR and a Procedure with a total cost of $100, they may choose to pay the first payment's principal first using the following Paysplits:<br/>
<table>
	<tr>

		<td><b>Amt Paid</b></td>

This can cause the Dynamic Payment Plan to be considered overpaid since we are Explicitly adding money to it and the attached production but Implicitly removing money from the plan itself. OpenDental should see these splits and calculate that two of them are intended offsets which should net to 0. The resulting Account Entries should look like:<br/>

        <Description>When a user creates a Dynamic Payment Plan, with attached production, payments can be made Explicitly or Implicitly linked to either one or both. In the event that the user wishes to create offsetting payments that do not Explicitly link to production, we want to be certain the Dynamic Payment Plan is not overpaid. We also do not want to allow money to be taken directly from production. If a user creates a Dynamic Payment Plan for Patient Joe, giving the plan a 5 APR and a Procedure with a total cost of $100, they may choose to pay the first payment's principal first using the following Paysplits:<br/>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Patient</b></td>
		<td><b>PayPlan</b></td>
		<td><b>Procedure</b></td>
		<td><b>Amt Paid</b></td>
		<td><b>PayPlanChargeType</b></td>
		<td><b>Notes</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Joe</td>
		<td>X</td>
		<td>X</td>
		<td>99.58</td>
		<td>Principal</td>
		<td>Payment on Payplan</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Joe</td>
		<td>X</td>
		<td>X</td>
		<td>99.58</td>
		<td>Unknown</td>
		<td>Income Transfer on Payplan with Procedure attached</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Joe</td>
		<td>X</td>
		<td></td>
		<td>-99.58</td>
		<td>Unknown</td>
		<td>Income Transfer on Payplan without Procedure attached</td>
	</tr>
</table>
This can cause the Dynamic Payment Plan to be considered overpaid since we are Explicitly adding money to it and the attached production but Implicitly removing money from the plan itself. OpenDental should see these splits and calculate that two of them are intended offsets which should net to 0. The resulting Account Entries should look like:<br/>

        <Description>A pay period with an 'incomplete week' at the end of the period should always pay 'straight time' rates for hours worked even when there are more than 40 hours.
The next pay period will be in charge of offsetting any 'straight time' with overtime since the week will complete in this next pay period.
Example: Create a pay period in October of 2024 that spans from the 3rd to the 16th with the start of the week being Sunday.
The last week towards the end of the pay period will be an 'incomplete week' (13th - 16th).
All overtime for the week of the 13th through the 19th needs to be calculated on the next pay period (17th - 29th).

        <Description>A pay period with an 'incomplete week' at the end of the period should always pay 'straight time' rates for hours worked even when there are more than 40 hours.
The next pay period will be in charge of offsetting any 'straight time' with overtime since the week will complete in this next pay period.
Example: Create a pay period in October of 2024 that spans from the 3rd to the 16th with the start of the week being Sunday.
The last week towards the end of the pay period will be an 'incomplete week' (13th - 16th).
All overtime for the week of the 13th through the 19th needs to be calculated on the next pay period (17th - 29th).

        <Description>A pay period with an 'incomplete week' at the end of the period should always pay 'straight time' rates for hours worked even when there are more than 40 hours.
The next pay period will be in charge of offsetting any 'straight time' with overtime since the week will complete in this next pay period.
Example: Create a pay period in October of 2024 that spans from the 3rd to the 16th with the start of the week being Sunday.
The last week towards the end of the pay period will be an 'incomplete week' (13th - 16th).
All overtime for the week of the 13th through the 19th needs to be calculated on the next pay period (17th - 29th).

        <Description>Adjustments automatically made due to the 'Calc Daily button makes adjustments if breaks over 30 minutes' preference should be considered by the Calc Weekly button even when the automatic adjustment causes a clock event to yield a negative time span.<br/>
When the preference is enabled, a work week with 41 hours of work and a 1 hour break (all on one day) should yield 40.50 total hours of work and 0.50 hours of break when calculating daily overtime.<br/>

There are three completed procedures, and there are two different providers.  Procedure #1 is D0220 for $100 that was completed by provider #1.  Procedure #2 is D0221 for $125 that was completed by provider #2.  Procedure #3 is D0222 for $150 that was completed by provider #1.  All three procedures have an InsPayEst of $100.  Procedure #1 has no WriteOffEst, procedure #2 has a $25 WriteOffEst, and procedure #3 has a $50 WriteOffEst.  These procedures are on one claim that is received.  There is an 'As Total' payment on this claim that has $300 paid by insurance and a $75 WriteOff that is under provider #1.  After the estimates are computed and the transfers are made by opening and closing the Income Transfer Manager Window, upon opening the Edit Claim Window, there will be a claimproc for each procedure, each with an InsPayAmt of $100. The claimproc for Procedure #1 will have a WriteOff==$0.  The claimproc for Procedure #2 will have a WriteOff==$25.  The claimproc for Procedure #3 will have a WriteOff==$50.</Description>

Arguably, we could have placed the partial refund in the 0-30 aging bucket. <br/>
But since the patient still owes money for the procedure from a year ago, the over 90 aging makes the most sense.<br/>
Also, none of these aging decisions affect any financial reports because those never allow backdating.</Description>

A patient has an insurance carrier and an associated insurance plan. An invoice statement is created with two procedures attached, each with a fee of $100.00 totaling $200.00 in procedures. Two adjustments are added, a positive adjustment of $10.00 applied to the patient's account and a negative adjustment of -$25.00 attached to Procedure #2. A dynamic payment plan is created for the patient, resulting in a $100.00 charge due immediately as a down payment and this pay plan charge is attached to the invoice. Two patient payments are made, a $100.00 general payment and $50.00 payment attached specifically to Procedure #1.

Then, a merchant fee of $100 is set for the payment, and adjustments are created using CareCredit Merchant Fee Adjustment Automation. This results in paysplits of 300 dollars each in the payment, the payment amount being set to $900, and negative merchant fee adjustments of $(33.33), $(33.33) and $(33.34) being attached to the procedures. Then, the first paysplit is deleted and inserted back into the DB, causing the paysplits order to change.

the insurance estimated payment would be 0.<br/>
3. The insurance plan excludes coverage for the same tooth as before but now the benefit is in a category (General D0000-D7999 and D9000-D9999). After making a claim, <br/>
the insurance estimated payment would be 0. This third test is hypothetical and not a real-world scenario.<br/>
4. An identical benefit as test 1 is made and a new procedure (D2391) happens on a different tooth (4).However, because this procedure code is <br/>

1. A claim is made for procedure D7140 on tooth "A" and the insurance pay estimate will be 50 because the age limitation doesn't apply until the patient is 14.<br/>
2. An age limitation benefit is made for a code group. Then we create a new claim for a procedure on tooth A which means the insurance pay estimate would be 50<br/>
because the age limitation hasn't taken effect yet.<br/>
3. Another age limitation like before is made but with a general category (D0000-D7999 and D9000-D9999). We create a new claim for a procedure on tooth A<br/>
and the insurance pay estimate would be 50 for this patient because the age limitation exclusion hasn't been met yet.<br/>
4. Finally a benefit identical to the benefit from the first test is made and a claim for a procedure on a tooth (K) which is outside the tooth range is made.<br/>
We would expect the insurance payment estimate to be 50 because the procedure isn't covered by the age limitation but is covered regularly.</Description>

1. A claim is made for the procedure that operates on a tooth (A). The insurance plan won't cover this because the patient is too old.<br/>
2. An identical Age Limitation benefit is made but is for a code group. Similarly, when a claim is made for the procedure on a tooth (A).<br/>
insurance will pay nothing because the patient is too old.<br/>
3. Another age limitation like before is made but with a general category (D0000-D7999 and D9000-D9999). We create another claim for the procedure <br/>

        <Description>Creates a patient that is 13 years old, along with an insurance plan and an age limitation benefit through age 13 <br/>
on procedure (D7140 - extraction). The procedure is 50% covered regularly.<br/>
1. A claim is made for procedure D7140 on tooth "A" and the deductible estimate will be $100 because the age limitation doesn't apply until the patient is 14.<br/>
2. An age limitation benefit is made for a code group. Then we create a new claim for a procedure on tooth A. The deductible estimate will still be $100<br/>
because the age limitation hasn't taken effect yet.<br/>
3. Another age limitation like before is made but with a general category (D0000-D7999 and D9000-D9999). We create a new claim for a procedure on tooth A<br/>
and the deductible estimate would be $100 for this patient because the age limitation exclusion hasn't been met yet.</Description>

        <Description>Creates a patient that is 14 years old, along with an insurance plan and an age limitation benefit through age 13 <br/>
on procedure (D7140 - extraction). The procedure is 50% covered regularly. Also create a deductible of $100.<br/>
1. A claim is made for the procedure that operates on a tooth (A). The insurance plan won't cover this because the patient is too old, so the deductible estimate should be $0.<br/>
2. An identical Age Limitation benefit is made but is for a code group. Similarly, when a claim is made for the procedure on a tooth (A).<br/>
insurance will pay nothing because the patient is too old, so the deductible estimate should still be $0.<br/>
3. Another age limitation like before is made but with a general category (D0000-D7999 and D9000-D9999). We create another claim for the procedure <br/>
and the insurance will pay nothing because the patient is too old, so the deductible estimate should be $0.</Description>
