<h2>General Setup</h2>
<p class="MarginBottomZero">Setting up an Insurance Payment Plan: </p>
<ol class="MarginBottomGap">
<li>Create and send the insurance <a href="claimedit.html">Claim</a>. Each claim can only be associated with one Payment Plan.</li>
<li>When the first insurance payment comes in, set up the Insurance Payment Plan before receiving the payment. <ol>
<li>If insurance is making a large first installment payment (this is uncommon) input this as the Down Payment. </li>
<li>Input the <i>Total Amount</i>.</li>
<li>Uncommon: Input the <i>APR</i> and interest information.</li>
<li>Input the <i>Number of Payments</i> or <i>Payment Amt</i>. </li>
<li>Click <b>More Options</b> and choose the payment frequency.</li>
<li>Click <b>Create Schedule</b> to create the Amortization Schedule. </li>
<li>In the <i>Tx Completed Amt</i> field, note the total expected principal payments from insurance (i.e, not including any interest).</li>
<ul>
<li>Adding the <i>Tx Completed Amt</i> creates a PayPlan Credit to ensure the the patient is not responsible for the amount expected to be paid by insurance.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
</li>
<li><a href="claimreceive.html">Receive Claim</a> and <a href="claimpayfinalize.html">Finalize Insurance Payment</a> as normal. <ul>
<li>To receive claim payments, with interest (uncommon), see <a href="insinterest.html">Interest on Insurance Payments</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As subsequent payments come in, receive them as <a href="claimpaymentsupplemental.html">Supplemental Insurance Payments</a>.</li>
<li>Once insurance has paid off the Payment Plan or stops making payments, click <b>Close Plan</b>.  <ul>
<li>The user is prompted to adjust the <i>Tx Completed Amt</i> to the amount actually paid by insurance, so if there was any balance unpaid, it is now patient responsibility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If the Insurance Payment Plan was created prior to receiving the first insurance payment, payments are automatically attached to the Insurance Payment Plan. If the Payment Plan is created after receiving insurance payments, users must manually mark insurance payments as attached to the Payment Plan. See Attaching Payments to an Insurance Payment Plan below for more information. </p>
<div class="Note">Note: <ul>
<li>Run the <a href="reportinspayplanpastdue.html">Insurance Payment Plans Past Due Report</a> to view patients with Insurance Payment Plan amounts past due.</li>
<li><i>Due Now</i> column in Payment Plan grid is for patient due amounts and does not apply to Insurance Payments due.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<br/><br/><h2>Attaching Payments to an Insurance Payment Plan</h2>
<p>Attaching/Detaching Payments to or from Plans: If a user creates the claim payment before the Insurance Payment Plan, payments are not automatically attached to the Payment Plan. To manually attach, open the claim payment by double-clicking the procedure to open the <a href="claimprocedure.html">Claim Procedures ( claimprocs )</a> window, then check <b>Attached to Insurance Payment Plan</b>.</p>
<p>To detach a payment from an Insurance Payment Plan, open claim, double-click the procedure to open the Claim Procedure window, then uncheck <b>Attached to Insurance Payment Plan</b>.</p>
<p>If entering the first payment on a claim and there are multiple Insurance Payment Plans attached to the patient without payments attached, there is a prompt to select the payment plan. If only one Insurance Payment Plan without payments attached exists, the payment is automatically associated to that payment plan. Supplemental payments to the same claim are automatically attached to the same Insurance Payment Plan as the original payment.</p>
<h2>View or Reopen Closed Payment Plans</h2>
<p>Payment plans that have been closed are still available to view or to reopen if needed. Only open Payment Plans can be edited; changing historical information is not recommended.</p>
<p class="MarginBottomZero">To show closed Payment Plans in the Payment Plan grid: </p>
<ol class="MarginBottomGap">
<li>In the Account Module, click the Show tab.</li>
<li>Check the box for <b>Show Completed Pay Plans</b>. This affects all workstations.</li>
</ol>
<p>All closed plans for the patient list in the Payment Plan grid in a light text color.</p>
<img src="images/payPlanInsClosed.png" width="757" height="71"/><p class="MarginBottomZero">To reopen a closed Payment Plan: </p>
<ol class="MarginBottomGap">
<li>Double-click the closed plan to open the Payment Plan window.</li>
<li>In the lower-right, click <b>Reopen</b>.</li>
</ol>
<img src="images/paymentplanReOpen.png" width="701" height="146"/><p>Only past activity shows in the Amoritization Schedule. To reinstate the Payment Plan, a new Amoritization Schedule must be created.</p>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p><b>When entering the insurance payment, it does not automatically attach to the Payment Plan even though there is a balance on the plan.</b></p>
<ul>
<li>First check that the Tx Completed Amt in the Insurance Payment Plan matches the Total Amount of expected payments.</li>
<li>If the Tx Completed Amt is 0, you will be unable to attach the payment to the plan.</li>
</ul>
