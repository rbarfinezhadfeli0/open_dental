<h2>Other Time Card Options</h2>
<p class="MarginBottomZero">Time card related settings can be found in the following places: </p>
<ul class="MarginBottomGap">
<li>Determine permissions and settings for Time Cards in <a href="security.html">Security</a>.</li>
<li>See <a href="timecardsetup.html">Time Card Setup</a> for managing pay periods, overtime, differential, and time format.</li>
<li>Change time card calculation in Preferences.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Add Adjustments to a Time Card</h2>
<p>Manually enter adjustments to account for other hours, additional overtime, etc. These adjustments create a separate row in the time card.</p>
<p>On the Employee Timecard, click <b>Add Adjustment</b> or double-click an existing adjustment to edit. </p>
<img src="images/timeCardAdj.png" width="577" height="395"/><p class="MarginBottomZero"></p>
<ul class="MarginBottomGap">
<li><b>Automatically Entered</b>: Indicates this adjustment was automatically entered.</li>
<li><b>Manually entered</b>: Indicates this adjustment was entered manually and protects this adjustment from being deleted from auto deletion.</li>
<li><b>Date/Time Entry</b>: Verify the date and time the adjustment is being entered. Defaults to today's date and the current time. Date/time determines the sort order of the adjustment on the time card. <ul>

<li><b>Hours</b>: Enter the number of hours to add to the time card. If removing hours, enter a negative number. Enter 0 if adding a note.</li>

<li><b>Protected Leave</b>: Marks the adjustment hours are protected. Protected leave hours are kept separate from all calculations for hours worked and payable hours, so they don't contribute to overtime calculations or any columns that sum total hours.</li>
<li><b>PTO Type</b>: Select a PTO Adjustment Type if it applies to this adjustment. Add PTO types from <a href="definitionstimecardadjtypes.html">Definitions: Time Card Adj Types</a>.</li>
<li><b>User</b>: The user who originally created the adjustment.</li>
<li><b>Note</b>: Enter any notes about the adjustment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Click <b>OK</b> to save.</p>
<p><div class="Note">Note: Adjustments add to overtime when the total hours is over 40 per week.<br/>  For example, if an employee worked 38 hours, and a user adds an 8 hour adjustment to that week, clicking <i>Calc Weekly</i> will calculate 40 regular hours and 6 overtime hours. </div>
</p>
<h2>Calculate Daily and Weekly Totals</h2>
<p>At the end of each pay period, calculate regular and overtime hours. Calculations can be run for all employees at once or per time card.</p>
<ol>
<li>Check employee time cards for errors (e.g. no missing clock-in/out events). Add any manual adjustments. Correct any time card errors. See <a href="timeclockedit.html">Time Card Edit</a>.</li>
<li>Calculate total hours worked each day, taking into account rules for overtime, differential hours, and the preference for breaks over 30 minutes. Adjustments will be made within a clock event; new rows will not be created. <ul>
<li>To calculate for all employees, click <b>Daily</b>.</li>
<li>To calculate for a single employee, click <b>Calc Daily</b> on their time card. If the results are not as anticipated or not the the user's liking, edit the rules in Time Card Setup and run it again. Alternatively, overrides can be made to individual clock events.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Calculate weekly overtime for employees who worked more than 40 hours in a week. Determine the start of the week in <a href="preferences.html">Preferences</a>, <i> Time Card first day of week for overtime</i>. <ul>
<li>To calculate for all employees, click <b>Weekly</b>.</li>
<li>To calculate for a single employee, click <b>Calc Week OT</b> on their time card. If the total hours for an employee in a week is over 40, an additional adjustment row will be added for overtime hours. The weekly calculation will cross pay periods.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<br/><p>Calculations are completed only if an employee is clocked out. If calculations cannot be made a note is added to the employee denoting the date and clock event error (e.g., <i>the employee did not clock out</i>). If using Clinics, total hours and overtime hours are assigned by Clinic. </p>
<h2>Hour Calculation Logic</h2>
<p>The math behind time card hour calculations is explained below.</p>
<p>Total hours = all hours worked (includes regular, overtime and differential (Rate 2) hours.</p>
<p>OT hours = overtime hours</p>
<p> Rate 1 hours = hours paid at the regular rate</p>
<p> Rate 2 hours = hours paid at the differential rate</p>
<p> Rate 3 hours = hours paid at the weekend rate</p>
<p> Rate 1 hours = (1 - (Rate 2 + Rate 3)/Total hours) * Regular hours</p>
<p> Rate 2 hours = (Rate 2/Total hours) * Regular hours</p>
<p> Rate 3 hours = (Rate 3/Total hours) * Regular hours</p>
<p> So Rate 1 hours + Rate 2 hours + Rate 3 Hours = Regular hours</p>
<p> Rate 1 OT hours = (1 - (Rate 2 + Rate 3)/Total hours) * OT hours</p>
<p> Rate 2 OT hours = (1 - (Rate 1 + Rate 3)/Total hours) * OT hours</p>
<p> Rate 3 OT Hours = Total hours - (Rate 1 + Rate 2 + Rate 3 + Rate 1 OT + Rate 2 OT hours)</p>
