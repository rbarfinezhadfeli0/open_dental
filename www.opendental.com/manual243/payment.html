The default clinic is determined by <i>Default Clinic for patient payments</i> set in <a href="preferences.html">Preferences</a>. Click the dropdown to select a different clinic. Clinic specified determines which payment processor credentials are used for merchant services if defined per <a href="clinics.html">Clinic</a>. If using <a href="depositslip.html">Deposits</a>, this is the clinic the payment is associated with.</li>
<li><b>Paid By</b>: The name of the patient making the payment. When a payment is split to multiple family members, the payment description in the Patient Account grid shows the <i>Paid By</i> name.</li>
<li><b>Entry Date</b>: The date the payment is entered. This is system-generated based on when the payment was created and cannot be changed.</li>
