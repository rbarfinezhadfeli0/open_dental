<div class="GeneralPageContent">
<p>The information below is provided as a resource when making encryption decisions related to <a href="securitycomputers.html">Computer Security</a>.</p>
<p>Open Dental does not provide technical support for encryption. Instead, consult an IT professional.</p>
<p>Encryption of data prevents unauthorized users from viewing data (PHI) when there is a data breach (e.g., hacking, theft, or loss of data). HIPAA does not require encryption of data. However, it is recommended. If there is a data breach, practices that have encrypted their data can qualify for Safe Harbor (patient notification may not be necessary or as difficult, see Breach Notification Rule below). Practices that have not encrypted the data must inform every patient that medical records have been compromised, and in some circumstances, notify the media.</p>
<p class="MarginBottomZero"></p>
<ul class="MarginBottomGap">
<li><b>Breach Notification Rule</b>: <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/breach-notification/index.html" target="_blank">https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/breach-notification/index.html </a>.</li>
<li><b>A Breach Example</b>: <a href="https://databreaches.net/2016/03/16/north-memorial-hospital-settles-hhs-charges-for-1-55m/">https://databreaches.net/2016/03/16/north-memorial-hospital-settles-hhs-charges-for-1-55m/</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Encryption plans need to include data at rest and in transit, as well as any other PHI that are stored on your systems. Documenting your data security policy is very important, as the burden of proof may rest upon you if there is a data breach.</p>
<h2>Encryption of Stored Data (at rest)</h2>
<p>Your encryption plan needs to include the data that is stored by Open Dental.</p>
<p class="MarginBottomZero"></p>
<ul class="MarginBottomGap">
<li><b>Database</b>: A database, generally MySQL, stores your patient data. By default, it is located at <b>C:\MySQL\Data\OpenDental\</b>.</li>
<li><b>OpenDentImages</b> (<a href="atozfolder.html">A to Z Folder</a>): This folder stores files that you capture, scan, or import.</li>
<li><b>Backups</b>: Copies of both the database and OpenDentImages folder should be encrypted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below are two options for encrypting stored patient data.</p>
<p class="MarginBottomZero"></p>
<ul class="MarginBottomGap">
<li><a href="encryptionbitlocker.html">BitLocker Encryption</a>: This is the recommended method for the database and OpenDentImages folder, if you have a compatible Operating System. BitLocker encrypts an entire drive in a manner that avoids the more complex EFS method of certificates associated with individual Windows users.</li>
<li><a href="encryptionefs.html">EFS Encryption</a>: This works well for the database because only the MySQL database service accesses the files, and this service always runs under one Windows user. It does not work well for the OpenDentImages folder because it does not work well for files that are shared to multiple users.</li>
<li><a href="encryptionmariadb.html">MariaDB Data-at-Rest Encryption</a>: For databases using InnoDB storage engine in MariaDB. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Encryption of Data in transit</h2>
<p>Data in transit refers to data that is moved from one place to another and therefore could be intercepted by someone else. This includes data that is transported across a network or stored on a removable storage device.</p>
<p><b>Removable storage device</b>: Use hardware encryption (e.g., encrypted hardware drives, encrypted USB drives) or software encryption (e.g.,Bitlocker).</p>
<p><b>Data that is transported across a network</b>: Open Dental does not move patient data off your network in any automated fashion. However, there are optional features that involve sending patient data to, or from, your Open Dental database.</p>

We use a 24 byte (192 bit) key, which falls well within the guidelines set by the federal government. Used for all eServices that require the eConnector.</td>

<p>If using Middle Tier, for external communication you must set up HTTPS over SSL.</p>
<p><div class="Note">Note: Mass Email, which is no longer offered, was not encrypted and treated the same as a plain text email.</div>
</p>
<h2>Sending PHI via Email or Text Messages</h2>
<p>In general, PHI should not be sent via plain text email or text message, even if using Open Dental for those communications. By default, Automated Messages do not send PHI, however you can manually compose messages that do include PHI. We do not recommend it.</p>
<p>To securely communicate with your patients, we recommend enabling Secure Email or using Secure Webmail via the Patient Portal.</p>
<p>If sending statements by email from Open Dental, use Secure Email or a secure third party. </p>
<h2>Technical Details</h2>
<p>Open Dental supports modern secure cryptographic protocols that provide communication security over computer networks. The browser interfaces for eServices utilize the Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 protocol as defined by RFC 5246 and further refined by RFC 6176 to remove backward compatibility with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) such that TLS sessions never negotiate the use of SSL version 2.0.</p>
<p>Secured data transmitted to and from customers and patients is and remains secure in transit.</p>
