<div class="GeneralPageContent">
<p>Payment Plans, formerly called Dynamic Payment Plans, are patient repayment agreements.</p>
<p>In the <a href="account.html">Account Module</a> Payment Plans grid, they show with the Type <i>DPP</i>.</p>
<img src="images/paymentPlanDynamicGrid.png" width="749" height="64"/><p><div class="Note">Note: <ul>
<li>The grid can also include <a href="paymentplanpatient.html">Old Payment Plan</a>, <a href="installmentplan.html">Installment Plan</a> and <a href="paymentplanins.html">Insurance Payment Plans</a>.</li>
<li>If production on a Payment Plan has been overcharged, the plan turns yellow. Run the <a href="reportdynamicpayplanovercharged.html">Payment Plans Overcharged Report</a> to find any overcharged production.</li>
<li>Payment Plans are only functional with an Insurance Payment Plan for the same procedures if set up correctly. See <i>Setting up a Payment Plan in Conjunction with an Insurance Payment Plan</i> at the bottom of this page.</li>
<li>The <a href="opendentalservice.html">Open Dental Service</a> is required to use Payment Plans. This service updates plans as needed daily. To set a time for Payment Plans to update, see <a href="preferences.html">Preferences</a>, <i>Pay Plan run time</i>.</li>
<li>Automatic changes to Payment Plans caused by insurance estimate changes, procedure adjustments, etc. are not tracked in the <a href="audittrail.html">Audit Trail</a>. We suggest saving a copy (e.g., a printout or PDF) of the original Payment Plan for reference. If a <a href="definitionsimagecat.html">Definitions: Image Categories</a> is assigned for Payment Plans usage, signed payment plans are automatically saved to the Imaging Module.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</p>
<p>To create a new Payment Plan, in the Account Module, click Payment Plan, Payment Plan.</p>
<img src="images/paymentPlanDynamic.png" width="915" height="633"/><p>Alternatively, double-click an existing Payment Plan to edit. </p>

<h2>Category / Patient / Guarantor </h2>
<img src="images/paymentPlanDynamicPatientInfo.png" width="346" height="74"/><p><b>Category</b>: Assign a category to the Payment Plan (e.g., Ortho, Implant). Useful to distinguish one Payment Plan from another when families have many plans. Customize the category options in <a href="definitionspaymentplancategories.html">Definitions: Payment Plan Categories</a>.</p>
<p><b>Patient</b>: The person who was treated. Click <b>Go To</b> to switch to their account. Patients can have multiple Payment Plans, and each plan can have a different guarantor.</p>
<p class="MarginBottomZero"><b>Guarantor</b>: The person who makes the payments. Click <b>Go To</b> to switch to the guarantor's account. Click <b>Change</b> to choose a different guarantor for the Payment Plan. </p>
<ul class="MarginBottomGap">
<li>When creating a new Payment Plan, the guarantor defaults to the family guarantor. </li>
<li>The guarantor can differ from the family guarantor and does not have to be in the patient's family.</li>
<li>If the Payment Plan guarantor is not in the same family as the patient, PayPlan Charge Due line items are posted to the guarantor's account instead of the patient's. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Lock Options</h2>
<img src="images/paymentPlanDynamicLock.png" width="173" height="30"/><p class="MarginBottomZero"><b>Permanent Lock</b>: Check to permanently lock the current terms of the plan. </p>
<ul class="MarginBottomGap">
<li> Prevents further changes to Pay Plan Production (e.g., adding procedures and adjustments or changing the production Amount Override) or Terms. </li>
<li>Plans that are locked cannot be edited. A new plan must be created instead.</li>
<li>If the preference, <i>Require full lock to save a Payment Plan if there is an APR entered</i>, is enabled, Permanent Lock must be checked when the plan has APR. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Unlock</b>: Option is available when opening an existing plan and Permanent Lock is unchecked. Click to unlock the <i>Terms</i> section in order to make edits.</p>
<h2>Terms</h2>
<img src="images/paymentPlanDynamicTerms.png" width="368" height="332"/><p><b>Date of Agreement</b>: Defaults to today's date. Can be changed to a past date. If the <i>Allow future dated transactions</i> preference is enabled, can also be changed to a future date. </p>
<p><b>Total Principal Amount</b>: The total amount of the Payment Plan, excluding interest. Calculated based on the attached production.</p>
<p class="MarginBottomZero"><b>Date of First Payment</b>: Set the date of the patient's first payment is due. Used to determine the Amortization Schedule. </p>
<ul class="MarginBottomGap">
<li>Defaults to one month from today's date. Can be changed to any date.</li>
<li>Used for the first periodic charge in the Amortization Schedule if there is no Down Payment amount or if the current date or a future date is entered.</li>
</ul>
<p class="MarginBottomZero"><b>Down Payment</b>: The amount the patient is paying upfront, before periodic charges. </p>
<ul class="MarginBottomGap">
<li>When the <i>Date of First Payment</i> is a past date, the Down Payment is due on the <i>Date of First Payment</i>. </li>
<li>If the <i>Date of First Payment</i> is the current date or a future date, the Down Payment is due immediately (today). </li>
<li>The full Down Payment amount is due, regardless of the <i>Handle Treatment Planned</i> setting.</li>
</ul>
<p class="MarginBottomZero"><b>APR</b>: The percentage of interest to charge on the principal balance of completed procedures. If entered, additional options are available to delay interest charges. Enter only one. If both fields are left blank, interest is applied to all Charges Due.  </p>
<ul class="MarginBottomGap">
<li><b>No interest for the first [ ] payments</b>: The number of payments before interest is applied.</li>
<li><b>Interest start date</b>: The date of the first interest charge.</li>
</ul>
<p class="MarginBottomZero">Interest is automatically calculated using the following method: </p>

<li>Calculates the number of payments, or the payment amount, based on the new balance (balance minus Down Payment).</li>

<li><b>Number of Payments</b>: Enter the number of payments. Payment amount calculates automatically.</li>

<li><b>Every other week</b>: Charges are scheduled for the same day of the week as the Date of First Payment and occur other every week (e.g., if the Date of First Payment falls on a Tuesday, subsequent charges are scheduled for every other Tuesday).</li>
<li><b>Specific day of the month</b>: Charges are scheduled to occur on the same week day and week number as the Date of First Payment (e.g., if the Date of First Payment falls on the second Tuesday of the month, subsequent charges are also scheduled for the second Tuesday of each month).  <ul>
<li>If the charge would fall on the fifth or sixth week of the month, it is instead scheduled for the same week day on the fourth week of a month (e.g., if the Date of First Payment was set for the fifth Tuesday in July, charges are actually scheduled for the fourth Tuesday of each month).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Monthly</b>: Charge dates are scheduled to occur on the same date as the Date of First Payment each month. <ul>
<li> If the day of the month from the Date of First Payment doesn't exist in a month, then the charge is scheduled for the closest available day in the month (e.g., if the Date of First Payment is January 31, for the month of April the charge is scheduled for the 30th).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Quarterly</b>: Charges are scheduled to occur on the same date as the Date of First Payment every three months.  <ul>
<li>If the date of the month from the Date of First Payment doesn't exist in a month a quarterly payment is due, then the charge is scheduled for the closest available date in the month (e.g., if the Date of First Payment is January 31, for the month of April the charge is scheduled for the 30th).</li>
