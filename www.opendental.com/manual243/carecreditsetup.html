<p>The <a href="econnector.html">eConnector</a> and <a href="opendentalservice.html">Open Dental Service</a> are required to utilize CareCredit and receive CareCredit <a href="alerts.html">Alerts</a>.</p>
<p class="MarginBottomZero">Click <b>Save</b> to save changes. If Quickscreen is enabled, and <i>CareCredit Approval Status</i> has not been added to an Appointment View, a prompt displays to add it. <br/><img src="images/careCreditPrompt.png" width="367" height="133" class="ImageInParagraph"/></p>

<li>Click No to continue without updating the Appointment Views. Views can be edited at any time.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Batch Quickscreen</h2>
<p class="MarginBottomZero">Batch Quickscreen is a CareCredit feature that pre-approves patients for financing. When enabled, Batch Quickscreen automatically attempts to pre-approve patients for their estimated appointment fees (rounded to the nearest dollar) prior to their appointment. </p>
<ul class="MarginBottomGap">
<li>Only patients that have not had any completed CareCredit transactions (purchase/refunds/Quickscreen) in the last 60 days are sent for Quickscreen.</li>
<li>Users must accept or decline the pre-approval before the patient can process a CareCredit transaction. Right-click on the appointment to accept or decline.</li>
<li>If <i>Merchant number by Provider</i> is checked, the provider on the appointment must have a merchant number entered.</li>
</ul>
<p> When enabled, a webservice checks if a patient is pre-approved. Batch Quickscreen is run at 7:20 AM (local to the practice) each morning. If we do not get a response back from CareCredit when running Batch Quickscreen, the batch has a pending status. Open Dental continues trying for a response. If no response is received after 24 hours, the batch expires.</p>
<p>QuickScreen is enabled by default, but can be turned off be selecting <i>Off</i>. Patients cannot individually opt out of QuickScreen.</p>
<p>When enabled, minor patients (under the age of 18) are processed using the guarantor of the family. When screened, the pre-approval status still displays on the patient, even if the screening was done on the guarantor. If the minor patient is not in a family, the patient is not screened, and a <i>BatchError log </i>in the CareCredit Transaction window is added.</p>
<p>The following information is required for patients to be screened: First Name, Last Name, Address, Zip Code, City, State, and Phone Number. Email, SSN, and Date of Birth are recommended but not required. The last 4 digits of the SSN is required when <i>Lookup Only</i> is selected.</p>
<p>A patients Quickscreen status can be viewed in the Patient Information area of the <a href="family.html">Family Module</a> or by adding the <i>CareCredit Approval Status</i> to the <a href="appointmentvieweditwindow.html">Appointment view</a>.</p>
<p class="MarginBottomZero">Quickscreen statuses:  </p>
<ul class="MarginBottomGap">
<li>Pre-Approved: Patient has been pre-approved. An application for this patient can be sent for financing.</li>
<li>Unable to Pre-Approve - Refer Patient to Credit Application: CareCredit is unable to pre-approve this patient.</li>
<li>Cardholder: The patient is a current CareCredit cardholder.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Closed Accounts</h2>
<p>When an office closes their account with CareCredit, their Merchant Number is automatically updated with an<i> x</i> when Batch Quickscreen is attempted. This lets Open Dental know the account is closed and not to allow transactions. </p>
<img src="images/careCreditMerchantClosed.png" width="434" height="29"/><p>To remove CareCredit buttons from different areas of the program (e.g., Treatment Plan and payments), uncheck the <i>Enabled</i> box.</p>
<p>If an account has been closed, and the bridge has not been disabled, a warning appears in the CareCredit Setup window, in the CareCredit Action window, and when attempting to make a CareCredit payment.</p>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>Microsoft WebView2 is required to use CareCredit. If not already installed, users are prompted to install WebView2 the first time CareCredit is opened. Installation only needs to happen once on each workstation.</p>
