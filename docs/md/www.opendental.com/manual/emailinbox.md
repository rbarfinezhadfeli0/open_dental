Email Client

Use the Email Inbox to view and send regular emails, secure emails, and WebMail messages.

In the [Manage Module](manage.html), click **Emails**.

![](images/emailinboxUser.png)

Emails that are displayed in this window vary depending on user and message type.

* [WebMail](securewebmailsend.html) messages only display when the provider is logged in.
* Regular and Secure Email replies are displayed for all users.
* Emails received by the practice/clinic/group email address are viewable by all users.
* User-specific emails are only viewable when the user is logged on.

This window can be left open in the background so that other areas of Open Dental can be accessed.

The [Open Dental Service](opendentalservice.html) is required to download new emails. New emails on the mail server are automatically synced in the background. Automatic download occurs every time Open Dental starts, when the inbox is opened, and at set intervals (see [Email Setup](emailsetup.html)).

## Setup and Addresses

* **Refresh**: Refresh the inbox for the selected email address.

## Inbox Tab

Click the Inbox tab to view received messages for the selected email address.

![](images/emailInboxInboxTab.png)

Inbox grid: This area displays both read and unread received messages. Unread messages are in bold. Click a column header to sort the messages alphabetically in ascending or descending order.

* **From**: The email address of the sender.
* **Subject**: The subject sent with the email.
* **Date Received**: The date and time the email was received by the mail server.
* **MessageType**: The type of message.
  + Regular email: A clear text email.
  + Encrypted email: An encrypted email.
  + SecureWebMail (sent via the patient portal)
  + Unsent
* **Sig**: *Y* Indicates the message is digitally signed (an encrypted email) and the sender is a trusted source. *N* indicates there is a digital signature, but the sender is not a trusted source yet. Click the *N* to add a trusted source.
* **Patient**: The patient attached to the email. If blank, there is no patient attached. Open Dental automatically attempts to attach a matching patient to incoming messages using this logic:
  + Searches for the patient if the email includes an attached Summary of Care (ccd.xml).
  + Searches for a match using LastName, FirstName, and Birthdate.
  + Searches for an exact email address match.
  + If multiple patients have matching a email address or there is no patient with a matching email address, no patient is assigned (left blank).
  + Archived patients are not considered when matching.

  Note: To manually assign an email to a patient, highlight the email then click **Change Pat**.

Message preview: Once an email is highlighted in the inbox, the preview area is shown.

* Double-click a message in the grid to instead open it in a new window.

## Sent Tab

Click the Sent tab to view all messages sent from Open Dental by the selected address. Sent messages can only be viewed, not edited. They can be deleted if there is no patient attached.

![](images/emailInboxSentMessages.png)

Sent Messages grid: This area displays outgoing messages. Click a column header to sort the messages alphabetically in ascending or descending order.
 The columns are the same as the Inbox, except for the following:

* **Sent To**: The email address of the recipient.
* **Date Sent**: The date and time the email was sent by the mail server.
* **Msg Type**: The status of the message.
  + Sent: A clear text email message was sent.
  + SentDirect: An encrypted email was sent.
* **Msg Source**: The message origin. For example, an email sent from the Recall List has a message source of *Recall*.

## Delete

To remove a message from the Open Dental inbox, highlight it then click **Delete**.

![](images/emailInboxDelete.png)

Deleting a received message removes it from the inbox only, not the email server. It is not downloaded from the email server again. Sent messages can only be deleted when there is no attached patient, otherwise it is only hidden in the Sent tab.

Incoming messages attached to a patient are deleted from the inbox, but are still visible in the Commlog and Progress Notes. Emails not attached to a patient are permanently removed.
