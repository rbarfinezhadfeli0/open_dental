Treatment Plan in Chart

Create treatment plans from the Chart Module using the Treatment Plans checkbox.

In the [Chart Module](chart.html), at the middle right, check the **Treatment Plans** box.

When checked, the Treatment Plans grid and Procedures grid display instead of Progress Notes. This view also allows users to create new treatment plans without leaving the Chart Module.

The Treatment Plans checkbox only displays when *Is TP View* is selected on the [Show tab](showtabchart.html).

Active and inactive treatment plans are listed in the Treatment Plans grid. Saved treatment plans are not listed.

* When a specific treatment plan is selected, its procedures are shown on the [Graphical Tooth Chart](graphicaltoothchart.html) and listed in the Procedures grid.
* When all treatment plans are selected, all treatment planned procedures are shown on the Graphical Tooth Chart and listed in the Procedures grid.

Creating active or inactive treatment plans or prioritizing treatment is done the same way it would in the [Treatment Plan Module](treatmentplan.html). See [Edit Treatment Plan](treatmentplanedit.html) for details.
