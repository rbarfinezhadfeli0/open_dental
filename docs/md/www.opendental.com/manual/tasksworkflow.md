Tasks can be sent to a [Task List or User Inbox](tasklists.html).

## General Information

* Tasks pop up on screen and a chime sounds when sent to a Task List that the logged-in user is subcribed to.
* Tasks attached to patients show in the patient's [Chart Module](chart.html), Progress Notes.
* If a task is left open on the screen, it automatically refreshes when an edit is made or a note is added by another user.
* To prevent task popups for the logged-in user, click **Manage Blocks** in the [Tasks Area](tasksarea.html).
* To also prevent sounds for blocked tasks, disable *Blocked task popups still make notification sound* in [Tasks Area](tasksarea.html), Task Options.
