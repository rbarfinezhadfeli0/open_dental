Use Blank Database

See [Installation](installation.html).

Getting to know the ins and outs of Open Dental will take some time. Because Open Dental is flexible, you have many choices in how you use the software and which features you implement. Below are recommendations on how to begin using Open Dental when starting with a blank database (e.g., transitioning from paper charts or a new practice starting from scratch).

## Setup

Before entering patient data, it is important to set time aside to address [HIPAA](../site/hipaa.html) issues and set up Open Dental for your practice.

## Patient Information and Appointments

We recommend starting with patients who have an upcoming appointment.

**Before the scheduled appointment:** Create records for patients and enter as much information as you have available.

* Create a new patient or family from [Select Patient](patientselect.html).
* Enter [Patient Information](patientedit.html).
* In the [Family Module](family.html):
  + Attach insurance plans, adding plans as you go. Check insurance plan information.
  + Assign recall types (Prophy vs Perio).
* In the [Chart Module](chart.html):
  + If known, attach treatment planned procedures.
  + If known, chart existing treatment (add procedures) and enter medical information.
* Create the appointment with the correct procedures attached.

**During the appointment**

* Update existing treatment and patient information.
* Set the appointment complete. Attach any added procedures.
* If treatment is needed, chart it (add procedures with a TP status).
* If treatment is needed, enter [Planned Appointments](apptplanned.html) for the next appointment (treatment that is priority #1). This information will by used by the front desk to schedule the next appointment.
* In the Treatment Plan Module, prioritize treatment, then save and print the treatment plan.

**Front Desk**

* In the Appointments Module, schedule the patient's next appointment.
  + If no treatment is needed, click Make Recall to schedule a recall appointment.
