Criteria to research a missing or failed prescription:

* It must be electronically transmitted. Printed and faxed prescriptions are not tracked.
* It must be no more than 5 days from the write date of the prescription.
* Mail order prescriptions: Allow 72 hours from transmission before reporting a prescription as failed or missing. Mail order pharmacies have 72 hours to update their database with prescriptions.

1. In the Ensora eRx window, Compose Rx tab, click the Edit dropdown.
2. Click **Detail**.
3. Scroll to the bottom. In the *Prescription History* section, any Failure is noted in the status column.
   * An *Action* of *ERx* is required for a prescription to be marked as *Failure*. Printed or Faxed prescriptions are not marked as *Failure*.
   * If the status is marked *Failure*, the prescription may be missing. Proceed to steps to Report a Failed Transmission.
   * If the status is marked *Verified*, the prescription may be missing. Proceed to steps to Report a Missing Prescription.
