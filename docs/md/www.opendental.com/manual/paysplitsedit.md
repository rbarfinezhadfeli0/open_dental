Paysplit Revise

Paysplits that have already been allocated to an adjustment, payment plan, procedure, or unearned income may be edited or reallocated.

In the [Payment](payment.html) window, double-click an existing [Paysplit](paysplit.html) to edit.

If the payment is attached to an [Accounting](accounting.html) entry, the original paysplits may only be edited within the first 48 hours of the payment date.

We recommend only editing existing paysplits on the same day the payment is created to avoid changing historical records and reports.

To edit a paysplit older than 24 hours, transfer the income instead of making changes to the original split. See [Income Transfer](incometransfer.html).

## Allocate a Paysplit to another Procedure or Adjustment

Open the original payment. From the Payment window, double-click a payment split to edit. The [Edit Payment Split](paysplit.html) window will open to the either the Procedure or Adjustment tab, depending on which is attached to the split.

1. Click **Detach** to remove the current item.
2. Select the family member to re-allocate the paysplit to (upper right).
   * Check *Is from another family* to select a patient outside the current family list. The [Select Patient](patientselect.html) will open. Select the patient to re-allocate to from here.
3. Click **Attach** to select a new procedure or adjustment.
   * If attaching a procedure, the [Select Procedure](selectprocedure.html) will open.
   * If attaching an adjustment, the *Adjustment Select* window will open, showing any unattached adjustments (i.e., adjustments not linked to a procedure).
4. Select the item and click **OK**. The clinic and provider will automatically update to what is assigned to the procedure or adjustment.
5. (Optional) Edit the paysplit Amount. If editing the amount, the difference needs to added or subtracted from another paysplit so the total payment amount matches the sum of the payment splits.
6. Click **OK** to save the paysplit.
7. Repeat steps 1-6 as needed for each paysplit that needs changed then click **OK** on the Payment window to save changes.
