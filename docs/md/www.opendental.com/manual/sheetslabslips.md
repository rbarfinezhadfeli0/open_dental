Lab slips are utilized with [Lab Cases](labcaseedit.html). Lab slips are typically customized by scanning the slip provided by a specific dental lab and using it as a background Static Image. Other required elements can be placed on top, such as instructions, due date, and license number. Lab slips support [Electronic Signatures](electronicsignatures.html).
