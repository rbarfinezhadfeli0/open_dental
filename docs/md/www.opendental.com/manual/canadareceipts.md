Canada Receipts

For [Canada](canada.html) users, in the [Account Module](account.html), click the **Statement** dropdown, **Receipt**.

The main purpose of printing receipts for patients is for income tax purposes. Receipts print the same as for other countries and include procedures, but without procedure descriptions, procedure codes, or tooth numbers.

Receipts do not include:

* statements
* claims
* claim payments

An optional note can be added to the bottom of receipts that reads: *KEEP THIS RECEIPT FOR INCOME TAX PURPOSES*. To display this, add the Output Text Field *StatementIsTaxReceipt* to the [Statement Layout](statementsheets.html).

Example of a receipt:

Note: If this receipt does not work for the practice, consider running and printing [Query #1852](https://opendentalsoft.com:1943/ODQueryList/QueryList.aspx) instead.
