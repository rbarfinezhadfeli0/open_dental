If the Students radio button is not selected, the [Provider](providerseditwindow.html) opens instead.

For [Dental Schools](dentalschools.html), students are providers who can use Open Dental for charting but may have restricted security permissions. Complete steps 1-4 on [Dental Schools](dentalschools.html) before adding the first student.

To add a student, in the [Dental School Providers](dsproviders.html) window, select a [Dental School Class](dsclasses.html) from the Classes dropdown, select the Students radio button, and click **Add**.

Enter the student information:

* **ProvNum**: Automatically generated once the student is saved. Cannot be changed.
* **Class**: The student's dental class.
* **Last Name/First Name**: The student's name.
* **Abbr**: Automatically generated using the first four characters of the last name and first initial of first name. Can be changed and does not need to be unique.
* **User Name:** The user name the student uses to [Log On](securitylogin.html) to Open Dental. Defaults to the student's ProvNum but can be manually changed.
* **Password**: Enter a password the student uses to log on to Open Dental. When editing an existing student, the password field is blank. To keep the password the same, leave it blank.
  + Students can change their password when they log on from [Main Menu](mainmenu.html), File, [Change Password](changepassword.html).

Click **Save** to keep changes or add the new student. New students are automatically assigned to the default student user group set in [Dental School Setup](dsusergroupdefaults.html).

To add instructors and other providers, see [Dental School Instructors](dsinstructors.html) and [Dental School Providers](dsproviders.html).
