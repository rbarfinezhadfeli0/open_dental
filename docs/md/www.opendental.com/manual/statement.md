* Alternatively, in the [Statement Window](statementwindow.html), click **Print** for a single statement.
* Or, in the [Billing List](billinglist.html), click Send for multiple statements.

Printed and emailed statements are automatically saved as PDFs in the patient's [Account Module](account.html) and [Imaging Module](images.html). They can be reprinted or viewed at a later time.

The internal statement sheet is designed to fit in #10 envelopes. To customize statements, see [Statement Layout](statementsheets.html).

Additional statement options can be found in [Preferences](preferences.html).
