* **Category**: Corresponds to folder names. Select the category the image should be stored in. Customize options in [Definitions: Image Categories](definitionsimagecat.html).
* **File Name**: The full path to the file in the [A to Z Folder](atozfolder.html). Files are automatically named using the fformat: LastnameFirstnameUniquenumber (the autoindex number of the document table in the database). They are stored in the patient's A to Z folder. Click **Open Folder** to open the file location.
* **File Size**: Displays the size, in bytes, of the selected file.

* **Provider**: Use the dropdown to associate a provider with the image. If using Clinics and providers are restricted to Clinics in [User Edit](securityusers.html), only providers available for the selected Clinic are options.
* **Description**: Enter a description for the image. This displays in the tree view with the file date.
* **Type**: If thumbnails are not displayed for a folder, determines the icon that appears for a file in the tree view.
* **Tooth Numbers**: If this file pertains to a tooth, enter tooth number(s) for reference.
* **Print Heading**: Check to include a heading with patient name, birthdate, and image date when printing the document.
