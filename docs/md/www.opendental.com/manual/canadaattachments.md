Canada Attachments

For carriers that accept electronic attachments, Canada users can add the attachment to the claim or predetermination.

For [Canada](canada.html) users, in a claim, click the Attachments tab, Canadian tab.

We recommend using Open Dental version 24.2.60 or greater when utilizing electronic attachments.

Attached Images: Lists files currently associated with the claim.

* Right-click an attachment in the list to open, rename, or remove it.
* **Add**: Search for a file to attach. File types accepted include TXT, DOC, DOCX, JPG, PNG, PDF, and TIF. Up to 30 files may be attached. Total attached files cannot be larger than 7 MB. Multiple uploads can be sent as needed.

  Note: Some insurance carriers may impose different restrictions such as limited file type support or smaller file sizes.

  + **Snipping Tool**: Click to launch the Windows Snipping Tool. Use the tool to snip an image on the screen.
  + **Paste Image**: Paste an image already saved to the clipboard.

* **Export**: Export all attached files to the path listed in the *Claim attachment export path* preference.

## Attachment Process

1. Send the claim or predetermination as normal, without any attachments.
2. The response returns as an Acknowledgment. Attachments are generally not needed if the response returns an EOB or Rejection.
3. Navigate to the Canadian Attachments tab.
4. Add images or files that are needed.
5. Click **Send Attachments**.

Attachments can be sent immediately after receiving the Acknowledgment response or much later if the attachments were requested by mail. Some carriers send the final approval EOBs directly to Open Dental as a mailbox item, see [Canada Claim History and ROT](canadaclaimsend.html).

To confirm sent attachments, view the *ClaimSend* permission in the [Audit Trail](audittrail.html).

Note: If attachments cannot be sent electronically, they can be mailed, or the carrier can be contacted for more submission options (e.g., the carrier's online portal, CDA SecureSend, BrightSquid, Fax, or Email).

## Setup

To utilize attachments:

* An image category must be marked as *Claim Attachments* in [Definitions: Image Categories](definitionsimagecat.html).
* The carrier must have a Supported Transaction Type of *Attachment*.
