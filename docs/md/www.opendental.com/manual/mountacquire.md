Select Mount and Acquire

Use the Select Mount and Acquire window to create mounts, take single images, or take images while placing them on a mount.

In the [Imaging Module](images.html), click **Mount / Acquire**.

An active registration key is required to acquire images. The trial version, which does not use a registration key, can still be used to test this feature as needed.

## Create a Mount

To create a blank mount, select the mount from the Mount section, then click **Create Mount**. The mount is added to the selected Image Category.

To create or edit mounts, see [Mount Definitions](mountdefinitions.html).

## Take a Single Image

To take a single image, select the device under Device, then click **Acquire**. The image is added to the selected image category.

## Take Multiple Images

To generate a mount and place images on it, select the Mount and Device, then click **Create Mount and Acquire**. The mount is added to the selected image category. Images automatically begin to acquire starting at item #1 on the mount. Acquiring stops automatically once all items in the mount have been acquired.

Alternatively, after selecting an existing mount (e.g., an existing blank mount) from the Imaging Module, click **Acquire** to fill any empty items.
