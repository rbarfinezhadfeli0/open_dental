The reports that display are customized by the practice in [Graphic Reports Setup](reportsgraphicsetup.html). Each report can show results for the entire practice, by provider or clinic, and for a specific date range.

Note: There are two security permissions that determine if a user can access graphical financial reports for other providers

* *Graphical Reports*: Allows a user to access the graphic reports.
* *Production and Income - View all Providers*: User can access graphic Production and Income reports for all providers. If a provider does not have this permission, they can still view their own reports, but only when they are logged on.

There are five types of graphic reports:

* Production
* Income
* Accounts Receivable
* New Patients
* Broken Appointments

Options:

* **Setup**: Click to set up tabs and reports.
* **Refresh Data**: Click to refresh the data of the reports.
* **Print Page**: Click to print all reports currently displaying in the tab.

Reports are grouped first by tab, then by cells in columns and rows.

* Hover over a specific point or column in results to display more details.
* If a legend shows on the report, click a legend item to quickly hide/unhide it in the report results.
* General practice data is colored blue. Data grouped by provider is based on the provider color.
* Hover over a report to display three clickable icons:
