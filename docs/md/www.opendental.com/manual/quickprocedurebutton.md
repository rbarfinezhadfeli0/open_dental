In [Procedure Buttons](procedurebuttons.html), double-click a quick button.

Alternatively, to add a new button, double-click on the white space of an availble row (see screenshot below).

Enter the button information.

* **Display Text**: The button text.
* **Procedure Code**: Enter the procedure code that will be applied when this button is clicked. Click [...] to select from the [Procedure Codes](procedurecodes.html). Only one code can be associated per quick button and it must exist in the prior to setting up the quick button.
* **Surfaces**: Enter the surfaces that will be applied when the button is clicked (B/F, V, M, O/I, D/L).
* **Display as Label**: Check this box to display the text as a label instead of a button. This text will not be click-able in the Chart Module.

Click **OK** to save. Click **Delete** the remove the button entirely.

In the Procedure Buttons window, when the Quick Buttons category is selected, the following will display.

Hints:

* Layout: New buttons are always placed to the right of the last button in the row. To add a space between buttons, create a blank button with no text, code, or surfaces, and check **Display as Label**.
* Surfaces: Any text can be entered for the surface, but Open Dental will validate the surface before applying to the procedure. For example, if a surface of MOPDL is entered, Open Dental will validate it to MODL. Validation will occur left to right and exclude any non-valid surfaces.
