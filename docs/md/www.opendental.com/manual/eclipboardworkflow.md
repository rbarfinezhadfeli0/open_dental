eClipboard: Workflow

Manually or automatically load forms to the [eClipboard](eclipboardsetup.html) device to act as a kiosk.

## One-Time Setup

The following must be set up prior to using eClipboard.

1. Sign up for the eClipboard service. See [eServices Signup](eservicessignup.html).
2. Determine eClipboard settings. See [eClipboard Setup](eclipboardsetup.html).
3. Enable consent forms to show in Patient Forms. See [Patient Forms](patientform.html).
4. Enable mobile layout for any sheets you want to use in eClipboard. See [Edit Mobile Sheet Def](sheetsetupmobile.html).
5. Ensure the patient has an appointment scheduled for today.

To manually send forms to eClipboard (such as consent forms) do the following:

1. In Open Dental, select the patient to load forms for.

## Automatically Send Forms to eClipboard

If using the eClipboard App to allow patient check-in, forms can be automatically loaded. These forms are determined in [eClipboard Setup](eclipboardsetup.html).

On the eClipboard App, the patient logs in using their first name, last name, and birthdate. Once they confirm their appointment time, the forms automatically populate.

## Importing Form Information

When a patient has completed a form, details can be imported into Open Dental. See [Import Patient Forms and Medical Histories](patientformsimport.html) for details.

It is important to manually review information before importing to ensure information is accurate and spelled correctly.
