## Integrated Texting Options

* **Choose New #**: Select this option to have a new number automatically assigned to the office for use with Integrated Texting.
  + Offices in the United States and Canada have the additional option of requesting a local number. Click into the phone number field and the window below appears.
    ![](images/eservicesAreaCodePrompt.png)
  + Enter the area code and click OK. This option is only available in the Basic View of the Signup Portal. Complete the signup process by making sure a monthly texting limit is entered above, and click the Save button at the bottom.
* **Use my Landline #**: Select this option to sign up for the Integrated Texting service with the existing landline phone number. This is limited to Open Dental practices located in the United States and Canada.

  + Click into the phone number field to enter the number. The following window displays:
    ![](images/eservicesLandlineNumberPrompt.PNG)
  + Enter the required practice information:
    - **Landline Phone Number for Texting**: Enter the current landline phone number.
    - **Company Name**: Enter the company name. This must match the name entered when registering for carriers above.
    - **First Name / Last Name / Contact Phone / Contact Email**: Designate a contact person. Enter a phone number different from the landline and an email address.
    - **Street Address / City / State / Zip**: Enter the office address.
  + After entering Landline information, contact Open Dental Support to complete the process. A Landline number cannot be used until Open Dental completes the process.

Note:

Regarding the **Use my Landline #** selection:

* Customers using VOIP numbers may experience a delay in service and should work directly with Open Dental support. A Letter of Authorization is required to use landline texting.
* Only United States and Canadian numbers work with this option. Mobile and some VOIP numbers are not supported.
* In rare cases, a telecomm provider may not support landline texting. Additionally, the telecomm provider may change suppliers at some time after sign up has occurred. This may result in the number no longer being available for this service, as not all suppliers support landline texting. In cases like these we can provide the practice with an alternate number utilizing a local area code.
