![](images/eConfirmationExclusions.png)

Determine which days of the week or specific dates to exclude sending eConfirmation and Web Sched Recall messages. If a message is scheduled to send on an excluded day, it is sent using the typical send time (as set in [eServices Misc](eservicesmisctab.html)) on the non-excluded day prior to the excluded day (e.g., if scheduled for Saturday, the message is sent on Friday).

**Clinic**: Select the clinic to apply exclusions to. Select *Default* to set default exclusions for all clinics.

**Use Default Settings**: Only displays when a clinic other than Default is selected. Check to use the default settings. Uncheck to set specific settings for the selected clinic only.

**Exclusion Days**: Highlight one more days of the week to routinely exclude when sending eConfirmations (e.g., weekends).

**Exclusion Dates**: Add specific dates to exclude when sending messages (e.g., holidays).

* **Show Past Dates**: Show exclusions dates that have passed.
* **Add**: Click to add a new date. The Choose Date window displays. Select the date from the calendar, then click OK to add.
* **Delete**: Highlight a date from the list, then click to delete it.

Note: Settings only affect future dates. Setting an exclusion date for today does not stop messages from sending.
