Patient Dashboard

The patient dashboard is a customizable view of basic patient information that can display on the right-hand side of Open Dental.

In the [Main Menu](mainmenu.html), click Tools, Patient Dashboards. Select the preferred dashboard from the available options.

Only dashboards marked as *Allowed* for a user's [User Group](securityusergroups.html) list in the tools menu. Dashboards are enabled per user and display on whichever workstation the user is signed in to. To create and edit dashboards, see [Dashboard Setup](dashboardsetup.html).

If a database has more than 28 dashboards, a new window opens. Double-click a dashboard from the list to enable it.
