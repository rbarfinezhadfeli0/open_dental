Message-to-Pay: What Patient Sees

See [Payment Portal Setup](paymentportalsetup.html).

Message-to-Pay is designed for patients to quickly make a payment from their mobile device.

## Initial Message

In the [Account Module](account.html) an Open Dental user clicks the Payment dropdown and Message-to-Pay. A text message or email is sent from [Message-to-Pay Edit](messagetopayedit.html) to the patient.

The patient clicks the payment link to open the [Payment Portal](portalpaymentsbypatient.html), or the statement link to open [Patient Portal](portalpatientsees.html).

## Payment Portal

Immediately upon opening the payment link, the patient can view their balance. The balance shown is as of the statement generated by the Message-to-Pay message.

The patient can choose from two options:

* **Pay Now**: Immediately make a one-time payment.
* **Verify and Pay**: Verify identity, then add a new card on file or pay with a previously used payment method.

## Pay Now

When **Pay Now** is selected, the patient is prompted to enter an amount, then they can enter card details to make the payment.

When **Verify and Pay** is selected, the patient chooses how to receive verification. The patient then enters the verification code and can make a payment.
