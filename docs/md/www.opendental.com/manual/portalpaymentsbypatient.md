Payment Portal

See [Online Payments](portalonlinepayments.html).

Practices using Integrated Credit Card Processors can enable the Payment Portal to allow patients to make online payments.

Offices can provide patients a link to the Payment Portal, found in [Payment Portal Setup](paymentportalsetup.html), or patients can access the Payment Portal through a link in the [Patient Portal](portalpatientsees.html). If using Message-to-Pay, Payment Portal is easily accessible via email or text message.

When using PaySimple, practices must provide a link to the Payment Portal. Patient Portal does not have a link to Payment Portal.

The flow of this window varies depending on how the window was accessed (i.e., direct link or Patient Portal), patient contact details, and payment processor.

For a detailed look at the Payment Portal, see [Payment Portal: What Patient Sees](paymentportalsees.html).
