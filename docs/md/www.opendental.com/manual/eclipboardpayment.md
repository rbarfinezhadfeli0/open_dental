Payments via eClipboard are available with an [Integrated Payment Processor](https://www.opendental.com/manual/paymentpatientcreditcard.xml).

Making payments and viewing statements is done via the [Payment Portal](portalpaymentsbypatient.html) which opens within the eClipboard app. See [Payment Portal: What Patient Sees](paymentportalsees.html) for details.

## Patient Currently in Session

If a patient is currently in an eClipboard session, click **Send Payment to eClipboard** to add the payment to the Check-in checklist.

Alternatively, this option can automatically be added to the Check-in checklist when *Allow payment when patient is checking in* is enabled in eClipboard Setup. Another checklist item (e.g., patient forms or patient photo) must display for patients to view payment information.
