Text Message

Text messages can be sent manually to both patients and non-patients.

In the [Main Toolbar](toolbar.html), click **Text**.

Before sending text messages, first sign up for [eServices Texting](textintegratedusage.html) and set monthly limits.

Choose one of the following options:

* **Patient**: Text the selected patient using the phone number on file.
  + Patients should have their wireless number entered in the [Edit Patient Information](patientedit.html) window and have their *Text OK* status set to Y (Yes).
  + If a patient's *Text OK* setting is currently N (No), there is a prompt to update the Text OK status before sending the message.
* **Another Person**: Text a non-patient. The current patient is cleared out and a Wireless Phone Number can be typed in manually.

**Find**: Only available when *Patient* is selected. Open [Select Patient](patientselect.html) to search for a different patient to text.

Longer messages may incur additional fees or send in multiple messages. For character limitations and message segment details, see [Integrated Texting Q and A](textmsgfaq.html).

* **Character Count**: Count of characters (includes tabs and spaces).
* **Message Count**: Count of messages that will be sent.

**Text Message**: Manually type a one-time message or [Right-Click](rightclicktextboxes.html) the text box for additional options.

Click **Send** to send out the text message to the recipient.

* A Commlog entry is automatically generated for text messages sent to a patient. Set the default Commlog Type for text messages in [Definitions: Commlog Types](definitionscommlogtypes.html).
* Messages can also be sent or viewed from the [Text Messaging Mailbox](textmsginbox.html).
* If the monthly texting limit is reached, there is a prompt to increase the [SMS Warning Amount](textintegratedmonthlylimit.html).

Note: Text messages are not a secure method of sending PHI.
