## Missing Teeth

Missing or hidden teeth are recorded at the patient's first visit, before entering treatment. This information is required when submitting claims and allows proper selection of pontics for bridges. Teeth marked as missing are not displayed on the [Graphical Tooth Chart](graphicaltoothchart.html) and are marked *skipped* by default creating a [Perio Chart](perio.html).
