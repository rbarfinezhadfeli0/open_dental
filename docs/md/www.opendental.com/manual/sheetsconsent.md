Consent form sheets can be customized to meet the needs of the practice.

In [Sheets](sheets.html), double-click on a custom sheet with the type of Consent.

Alternatively, in Sheets:

* Click **New** and choose *Consent* as the Sheet Type to create a new consent form from blank.
* Select an existing Custom *Consent* sheet and click **Duplicate** to create a copy of an existing consent form.
* Select the existing Internal *Consent* sheet and click **Copy** to create a copy of the default consent form that can be edited.

Additional information:

* Consent forms support [Electronic Signatures](electronicsignatures.html).
* To create a consent form for a patient, see [Consent Form](consentforms.html).
* Consent forms can be sent to the [eClipboard](../site/eclipboard.html) when [Mobile Layout](sheetsetupmobile.html) is enabled.

Also see: [Sheet Def Properties](sheetproperties.html) and [Sheet Field Types](sheetsaddelements.html)

To customize a Consent sheet type, see [Edit Sheet Def](sheetsetup.html).

Note: The Input Field for *ToothNum* is unique to Consent forms. Prior to having a consent signed, add the tooth number manually from the [Consent Form](consentforms.html) Fill Sheet window. Once entered, the field cannot be altered in the eClipboard app or on the kiosk by the patient.
