In the [Imaging Module](images.html), click **Video**.

Any webcam or intraoral camera should be compatible with Open Dental. For additional details, see [Imaging Camera Compatibility](imagingcameracompatibility.html)

Note: An active registration key is required to use Video except in the Trial Version. Video Capture is not available for Open Dental Cloud.

**Camera**: Select the camera to use.

**Capture**: Click to capture the image or use the space bar.

**Close**: Click to close the live feed.

Where an image is saved depends on the following:

* If an image is taken directly onto a mount, the image is saved to the mount.
* If a default category is selected for *Default Image Category for video capture* in Preferences, the image is saved to the default category.
* If no *Default Image Category for video capture* is set, the image is saved to *Default Image Category* in Preferences.
* If no *Default Image Category for video capture* and no *Default Image Category* is set, the image is saved to the currently selected image category.
* If no *Default Image Category* is set, no *Default Image Category for video capture* is set, and no image category is selected, the image is saved to the top-most image category.
