## Available Fee Guide

Many fee guides are available in the Fee Sched Files list. The fee guide naming convention includes the province abbreviation, providing entity abbreviation, fee guide abbreviation (if present), year, and specialty (e.g., ON\_ODA\_2025\_GP). Double-click a fee guide to import it.

Some fee guides require additional information, such as an Open Dental update or contacting support. The below guides have unique requirements. All other guides are available in the Fee Sched Files list.

| Province | Organization | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Alberta | Alberta Dental Association (ADA) | Formerly ADAC. Contact Open Dental Support to obtain fees. Per the Member Services Director at the Alberta Dental Association (12/20/2023), we cannot distribute the fee guide. You must provide a copy of the fee guide, then Open Dental Support can remote in and assist with converting the data and importing the file. |
| British Columbia | British Columbia Dental Association (BCDA) | Importing these fee guides requires the BCDA Member ID and Fee Guide Password. The password is a 5-digit password provided by the BCDA. This fee guide requires Support to import.    2025 - Version 24.3.44 or 24.4.17 or greater required. |
| British Columbia | Pacific Blue Cross (PBC) | Contact Open Dental Support to obtain fees. |
| Manitoba | Manitoba Dental Association (MDA) | Contact Open Dental Support to obtain fees. You must provide a copy of the fee guide, then Open Dental Support can remote in and assist with converting the data and importing the file. |
| Newfoundland and Labrador | Newfoundland and Labrador (NLDA) | Contact Open Dental Support to obtain fees. |
| Ontario | Ontario Dental Association (ODA) | Due to our agreement with the ODA, a member ID and password is required to import fees. These can be obtained from the ODA. Open Dental Support is required, as well as an update to one of the versions listed below.  Open Dental only provides the low end of fee ranges. Users are encouraged to examine their fees and can make changes manually after the import. 2025 - Version 24.2.65 or 24.3.32 or greater required. |
| Prince Edward Island | Dental Association of Prince Edward Island (DAPEI) | Open Dental has opted not to include the DAPEI Fee Schedule due to their onerous licensing agreement. Users must retrieve a copy of the fee guide on their own and manually enter the fees into Open Dental. |
| Quebec | Quebec Dental Association (ACDQ) | Contact Open Dental by emailing *canada@opendental.com*. We need to verify eligibility prior to providing the fee schedule. As required by ACDQ, only fee schedules for the current year and next year can be downloaded. Prior years are not available. This fee guide requires Support to import. |

## Updating Canada Fee Guides

When a new fee guide is released, we recommend making a copy of the original fee guide for reference, then importing the new fees into the original fee guide. By doing it this way, the fees are updated and fee guides do not need to be reassigned to providers.

**Update Open Dental**
 Some fee guides require an Open Dental [Update](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help244%EA%A4%B7updateinstall.html) prior to importing the latest fee guide. Find the fee guide in the list below to see the required Open Dental version.

**Create a backup of the original fee guide:**

1. Create a new fee guide named after the original (e.g., UCR2023\_copy). See [Fee Schedules](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help244%EA%A4%B7feeschedules.html).
2. Under Lists, [Procedure Codes](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help244%EA%A4%B7procedurecodes.html), click Fee Tools.
3. Under Select Fees, select the fee guide to copy (the original).
4. In Copy To, select the fee guide to copy the fees into (e.g., the new fee guide, UCR2023\_copy).
5. Click Copy. The new fee guide will now be a copy of the original fee guide.

**Import fees into the original fee guide:**

1. Clear the original fee guide:
   1. Click Fee Tools.
   2. Under Select Fees, select the original fee guide.
   3. Click Clear to remove the fees from the original fee guide.
2. Import the new fees into the original fee guide:
   1. Click Fee Tools.
   2. Under Select Fees, select the original fee guide.
   3. Click Import Canada.
      * Some guides require a Member ID and Password from the providing province.
      * If fees have not been cleared (the fees still exist in the original), a warning displays. Click OK to proceed, or Cancel to close without importing.
   4. The Fee Sched Pick Remote window displays all of the fee guides currently available for download. To import, double-click on a fee guide or select it then click OK. A message indicates when the import is finished.
   5. Rename the fee guide to include the current year.

Note:

* Custom codes created by the office may need fees re-entered after updating a fee guide.
* To update the fees on treatment plans for all patients, see Update Fees in [Fee Tools](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help244%EA%A4%B7feescheduletools.html).

## Troubleshooting

![](images/canadaFeesSkipped.png)

After importing a fee guide, a message displays indicating the number of fees that were imported, and the number that were skipped. Skipped fees occur when there is no corresponding procedure code in Open Dental.
