These steps explain how to use the classic [public health](publichealth.html) screening form.

* In [Preferences](preferences.html), uncheck *Screening Use Sheets* to use the classic form.
* Before patients can be screened, set up screening groups and add patients. See [Public Health Screening](publichealthscreenings.html).

Double-click the screening group to select it. Screening groups are grouped by date. If needed, change the date and click **Refresh**.

Patients should already list under Patients for Screening.

* Only patients with *Allowed* permission will be screened. Change permissions if needed by right clicking on a patient.
* To change patient information, double click a patient then enter on the [Edit Patient Information](patientedit.html).
* Anonymous screenings do not require adding a patient or setting screening permissions. See Anonymous Screenings at the bottom of this page.

Click **Screen Patients**. The classic screening form for the first patient with an *Allowed* permission that hasn't been screened yet will open.

**Row**: Determines the sort order of the screening in the list of screenings. Automatically uses the next row in the sequence.
**Name**: Cannot be changed from here.

**Grade level, age, birthdate**: Automatically populates if information is already entered on the Edit Patient Information window. Change if needed.

Charting Options: Check a box ![](images/publicClassicUnknown.gif) to select it. Each option has three available states: blank, checked, or unknown. You only need to enter information that is required by your organization.

**Race ethnicity, gender, urgency**: Automatically populates if information is already entered on the Edit Patient Information window. Change if needed.

Click **OK** to save. A new row will show in the Screenings list for this patient.

If there are more patients to screen, a new screening form will open for the next patient who has an *Allowed* permission and hasn't been screened. The new patient's information will be auto-filled if known. If not known, the information from the previous screened patient is automatically used.

Note:

* To exit screenings, click **Cancel** on the screening form. To resume, click **Screen Patients** again.
* If a patient screening is deleted, their permission level returns to *Unknown*.

## Add Anonymous Screenings

Anonymous screenings do not require adding a patient or setting screening permissions.

1. Click **Add Anonymous.**
2. Enter the information. All information except Name can be entered.
3. Click **OK**, a new screening form will open, filled in with information from the previous individual.
4. When finished entering all anonymous screenings, click **Cancel** to close the screening form.

If the person needs treatment, consider entering them into the system as a regular patient (if not already entered) and putting their patient ID number in the *Comments* section.
