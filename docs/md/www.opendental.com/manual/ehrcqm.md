EHR Clinical Quality Measures

This information applies to EHR Modified Stage 2 for Program Years 2015 to 2018. For current information, see:

* [EHR Modified Stage 2](../site/ehrmodified2.html)
* [2019 Program Requirements - Medicaid](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/EHRIncentivePrograms/2019ProgramRequirementsMedicaid.html)
* [Open Dental EHR](https://opendental.com/site/ehrlicense.html)

Also see [EHR Dashboard](ehrdashboard1.html).

Reporting Clinical Quality Measures (CQMs) is an EHR Modified Stage 2 requirement. CQMs are tools used to measure and track the quality of healthcare services.

Open Dental reports on 9 CQMs. These CQMs were chosen for certification because they cover at least 3 National Quality Strategy (NQS) domains, focus on high-priority health conditions and best-practices for care delivery, and are applicable to dental providers.

## Calculations

* Denominators are based on [EHR Encounters](ehrencounters.html). By default, encounters are not automatically generated based on completed procedures or appointments. However, you can automate the process if you set a [EHR Default Encounter Code](ehrencountercode.html). If you choose not to set a default, you must manually generate CQM encounters that are appropriate for each measure.
* Numerators are based on completing specific actions and/or [EHR Interventions](ehrinterventions.html).

For specific denominator and numerator logic for each CQM, see [EHR Clinical Quality Measure Descriptions](ehrcqmdef.html).

Some CQMs use specific code systems in calculations. To download coding systems and see which codes are used in CQMs, see [Importing Coding Systems](codesystemimport.html).
