Delete Appointment

On rare occassions, it may be appropriate to delete an appointment.

In the [Appointments Module](appointments.html), select an appointment. In the toolbar, click **Delete**.

Alternatively:

* In the [Appointments Module](appointments.html), right-click on the appointment. Select *Delete*.
* In the [Chart Module](chart.html) Progress Notes, right-click the appointment. Select *Delete*.
* Double-click an appointment. In the [Edit Appointment](aptedit.html) window, in the bottom right, click **Delete**.

Appointments should not be deleted without considering how they will be tracked.

* If the appointment was missed or was cancelled without 24-hour notice, then use [Break Appointment](apptbreak.html).
* After breaking the appointment, consider sending it to the [Unscheduled List](unscheduled.html) for followup.
* If the patient really does not want followup, make sure the appointment is still in the [Planned Appointments](apptplanned.html) list so that it will show in the [Planned Appointment Tracker](appttracker.html).
* Recall appointments can be deleted as they will continue to show on the [Recall List](recalllist.html) for followup.
* Completed appointments cannot be deleted if procedures are attached and *Prevent changes to completed appointment with completed procedures* is enabled in [Preferences](preferences.html).
