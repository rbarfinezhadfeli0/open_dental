Wiki Search

Use the Wiki Search to quickly find a wiki page.

In the [Wiki](wiki.html), click **Search**.

![](images/wikiSearch.png)

**Search Bar**: Enter a search term. Results are listed in this order:

1. Pages that have matching keywords, listed alphabetically.
2. Pages that have matching characters in the Page Name, listed alphabetically.
3. Pages that have a link, where the linked page has the search term listed as a keyword.
4. Pages that have matching characters anywhere in the content, listed alphabetically.

**Search**: If Ignore Content is unchecked, users must click **Search** or press Enter on the keyboard to filter results.

**Ignore Content**: Choose what content is included for search terms. Checked by default. Uncheck to save this as the default setting for the current user.

* Checked: Only search page names, and ignore page content.
* Unchecked: Search all wiki content.

**Archived Only**: Choose to view archived wiki pages.

* Checked: View archived wiki pages only.
* Unchecked: Archived wiki pages are not listed and do not appear in search results.

**Exact Match**: View only exact matches for the typed search term.

* Checked: Search results only include wiki pages with the term exactly as typed. For example, if searching "Training Employee", but the wiki is titled " New Employee Training", the wiki page would not be displayed. Searching "New Employee" would yield a result.
* Unchecked: Search results include wiki pages that includes the same words searched, even if the exact term differs. For example searching "Training Employee" would bring up the page "New Employee Training".

**Show Main Pages**: Sort page results alphabetically based on the following:

* Pages with *Main* entered as a keyword. See [Wiki Edit](wikiaddedit.html) for information on adding keywords.
* Pages with the search term in the page title.
* Pages with the search term in the page content.

**Run on report server**: Only displays when a [Report Server](reportserver.html) is used.

* Checked: Run search using the report server. Useful to prevent slowness.
* Unchecked: Run search using regular server.
