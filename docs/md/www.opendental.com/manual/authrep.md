Authorized Representatives

See [Patient Portal](portalhostedbyod.html).

Authorized representatives can view another patient's health information in the Patient Portal and receive [Web Sched](../site/websched.html) notifications on another patient's behalf. Several settings in Open Dental control who is authorized to see a patient's health information.

**Patients**: Can always view their own health information.

**Guarantors**: By default, guarantors have access to all family member information. This is determined by the *Allow guarantor access to family health information in the Patient Portal* preference. If enabled, guarantors can view information for all family members. If disabled guarantors can only view their own information. This is a global setting that affects all guarantors.

**Guardians**: Can view health information for any patient for which they are designated as Guardian ([Edit Patient Information](patientedit.html), [Family Relationships](familyrelationship.html), Guardian is checked).

**Responsible Party**: Can view health information for any patient for which they are a responsible party (Edit Patient Information window, Responsible Party).

Authorized representatives can view:

* Statements/Receipts
* Some patient information from the Family Module, Imaging Module, Webmail, and Care Summary (if using EHR).

Note: Treatments Plans cannot be viewed unless they are added to the Imaging Module.
