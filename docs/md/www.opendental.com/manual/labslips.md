Dental [Lab Case](labcaseedit.html) slips are a type of sheet.

* To customize a dental lab slip, see [Lab Slip Layout](sheetslabslips.html).
* To set a default slip for a dental lab, see [Laboratories](laboratories.html).
* Lab slips support [Electronic Signatures](electronicsignatures.html).
* View a patient's lab slips in the [Chart Module](chart.html) and [Account Module](account.html).

Once a lab slip has already been created, click **Edit Slip** to view or edit the existing lab slip. Signed lab slips are locked by default. Click **Unlock** to edit the lab slip.

Instructions entered on a lab case automatically insert into the Instructions field when the slip is first created. If editing instructions after the slip has been generated, users must edit the instructions on both the lab case and within the lab slip.

Pale yellow areas indicate data entry areas.

To print or email a lab slip, click **Print/Email**.

See [Fill Sheet](sheetsfillout.html) for additional information on the buttons and fields below the sheet. Created lab slips can also be viewed from the patient's Chart Module and Account Module.
