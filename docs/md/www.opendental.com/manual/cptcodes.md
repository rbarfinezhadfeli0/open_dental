CPT Codes

See [EHR Setup Window](ehrsetupwindow.html).

Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes are five digit numeric codes used to describe medical procedures and physician services. They are maintained and distributed by the American Medical Association (AMA). CPT Code books can be purchased from the AMA.

CPT Codes cannot be imported into Open Dental. They must be manually added and, if desired, cross coded to dental procedure codes. See [Cross Codes](crosscode.html) and [Medical Insurance](medicalins.html).
