EHR Interventions

When a provider documents an intervention for an eligible patient encounter, it counts towards [EHR Clinical Quality Measures](ehrcqm.html). Interventions are documented while entering patient [EHR Vital Signs](vitalsignsenter.html) and [Smoking Status](smokingenter.html), or can be viewed and added on the Interventions window.

To view all patient's interventions, on the [EHR Dashboard](ehrdashboard1.html), click Interventions.
