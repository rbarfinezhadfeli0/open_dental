Clone

Patient Clones are a useful feature for practices that have different types of providers who treat the same patient.

The tool can be used to create one or more duplicates of the original patient, with data continually synced between patient and clone. For example, a general dentistry office may also provide orthodontic and endodontic treatment, so clones can be used to track the specialty treatment separately.

## Patient Clones in the Family Module

The Patient Clone feature can be enabled as needed. From the [Family Module](0_family.html), you can manage patient clones, create new patient clones, and view patient clone relationships.
