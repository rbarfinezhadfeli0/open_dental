Appointment Pinboard and Search

The Pinboard is a useful tool for moving or scheduling appointments and searching for appointment openings.

In the [Appointments Module](0_appointments.html), on the right under the calendar, is the Pinboard area.

Appointments can be created on the Pinboard or existing appointments can be moved to the Pinboard. Moving to the Pinboard is helpful if an existing appointment needs to be moved to a new date.

You can manually move the appointment or use the search tools to find a suitable date.

## Search Options

If the schedule is booked out for more than a few days, manually searching for a slot can be time-consuming. Instead, easily search for available openings using the search tools.

The basic search allows you to filter availability by date, time, and provider.

Use the advanced search to filter even further by blockout or clinic.
