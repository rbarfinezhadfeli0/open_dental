Sales Tax for Open Dental

See [United States Regulatory Information](regulatoryinformationusa.html).

The Supreme Court issued a decision in 2017 that States may charge tax on purchases made from out-of-state sellers: <https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/17-494_j4el.pdf> In response to this decision, we collect sales tax in a number of states. This change is complex, involving new laws and rules in each state. Some states do not tax software, so we do not list those states here.

## Separating out support services from the software

In most states where software is taxable, the associated support services are also taxable. A few states do allow exemption for certain support services, if they are stated separately from the software. But the intent is for truly separate one-time charges, not recurring charges that are closely linked to software updates. Our fee is for combined software updates and support. If we were to arbitrarily state that 50% of the fee was for software and 50% for support, we would be exposing ourselves to very significant risk of lawsuits from state governments. This is because, when there are mixed transactions, it's too arbitrary, and the government tends to make claims about the "true" object compared to the incidental object.
[Sales Tax and the True Object Test.](https://www.picpa.org/professional-resources/research-publications/cpa-now-blog-archive/cpa-now/2022/09/19/sales-tax-and-the-true-object-test)
 Software companies frequently fail this test if they claim the true object is service. We must legally charge sales tax on the entire monthly support fee.

The wording on our [Ordering](order.html) page describes the monthly fee as, "Includes the software, full telephone support, and all software releases as they come out." Our [License](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7licenses.html) describes, "Open Dental Software, Inc distributes and supports this software through an authorized purchase." and "software updates as part of a monthly support plan are considered to be purchases as well".
