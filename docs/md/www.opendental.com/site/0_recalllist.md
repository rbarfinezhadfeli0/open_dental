Recall List

Use the Recall List to send and track recall appointment reminders.

The Recall List includes patients who need to be scheduled for a recall (e.g., prophy or perio) appointment. Reminders can be easily generated and appointments quickly scheduled from the list.

Once a reminder is sent, patients can be optionally hidden from the list until it's time for another reminder.

## Filters and More

Use the filters to determine which patients are included on the list. Easily filter by recall due date, recall type, provider, and more to find the patients you want to schedule.

Use the Set Status feature to quickly set the recall status of one or more patients. This is helpful to indicate how a patient was contacted, can't be reached, etc.
