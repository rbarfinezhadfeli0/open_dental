# About EHR

The EHR Incentive Program was renamed to Promoting Interoperability in April 2018. This program provides incentive payments to eligible professionals (EPs) as they adopt, implement, upgrade or demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR software. Providers have to meet specific requirements to receive incentive payments. See [Official Website for Medicaid and Medicare EHR Incentive Programs](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/EHRIncentivePrograms/index.html) (cms.gov).

Beginning with the EHR reporting period in Calendar Year 2019, participants in the Promoting Interoperability (PI) Programs are required to use 2015 edition certified electronic health record technology (CEHRT). Open Dental has decided not to develop a certified 2015 edition software.
 See [2015 Edition Update](ehrlicense.html).

Open Dental was EHR certified from August 2011 through December 2018, for both the 2011 Edition and 2014 Edition. Providers who started early in the program had the opportunity to receive all incentive payments.

## Medicaid

EPs could receive up to $63,750 total over 6 years (typically pediatrics, community health centers, FQHCs, rural health clinics). The last year to begin participation in the Medicaid EHR Incentive Program was 2016.

## Medicare

EPs could receive up to $43,720 total over 5 consecutive years (typically doctors of surgery or dental medicine). The last year to start participation was 2014. Every year providers must demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR software by meeting thresholds for a number of objectives.
