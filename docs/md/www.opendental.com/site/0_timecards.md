An individual employee time card shows any clock in or out events, breaks, and adjustments for a pay period. Users can edit existing clock events (e.g., to correct a clock in time) or add adjustments (e.g., PTO) and calculate overtime for the pay period. Editing time cards can be restricted as needed using security permissions.
