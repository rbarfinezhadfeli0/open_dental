## Set Priority & Estimates as of

The *Set Priority* list is used to assign priorities to the procedures on the Treatment Plan. This affects how treatment is sorted in the Procedures grid. A subtotal is calculated for each priority. Use priorities to ensure treatment estimates are calculated in the correct order.

The *Estimates as of* dropdown allows you to select a future date to see what Treatment Plan estimates will be. This is helpful if treatment is expected to be completed in a new benefit year or once a waiting period has ceased.
