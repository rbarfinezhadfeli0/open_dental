## Getting Started

Patient Portal is available at no additional fee for practices on support with a unique, active registration key.

For a list of supported browsers see [Computer Requirements](computerrequirements.html).

Once you're ready, your office can select which Patient Portal Features are enabled. You can also determine which patients get invites to or access to Patient Portal.

Your office also has the option to host your own Patient Portal. This is a highly technical process and Open Dental does not provide support on this setup.
