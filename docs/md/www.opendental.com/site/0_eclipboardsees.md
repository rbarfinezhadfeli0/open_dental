# eClipboard: What Patient Sees

The [eClipboard](eclipboard.html) eService app can be launched on a [Tablet](tablet.html) device.

Patients can check in for appointments, fill out forms, and make payments using the app.

Alternatively, patients can use eClipboard Web which allows them to fill out items from a web browser. eClipboard Web is nearly identical to eClipboard 25.

The screenshots on this page reflect the eClipboard 25 app.

## Patient Check-in

When a patient arrives for their appointment, they can check in.Their appointment status is automatically updated in the [Appointments Module](0_appointments.html).

If the patient has an appointment scheduled for the day, they are shown a checklist of items to complete. This can include filling out specific forms, viewing their statement and making a payment, taking photos, and more.

For eClipboard 25 and eClipboard Web, forms can be set up and customized using [Sheets](0_sheets.html) or [eForms](0_eforms.html). For eClipboard 24, forms can be set up and customized using [Sheets](0_sheets.html) only.

With eForms, you can set up conditional questions. This means that patients will only see questions applicable to them.

After forms are filled out, data can be imported into your database, saving valuable time for data entry.

## Image Capture

The eClipboard app can prompt patients to take a patient photo (selfie) or ID and insurance cards.

[Saved Treatment Plans](0_treatmentplan.html) can be sent to the eClipboard app for patients to digitally sign.
