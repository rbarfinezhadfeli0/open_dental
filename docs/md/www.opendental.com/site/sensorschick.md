It might also simply be called "Upgrade Utility". Whichever Schick utility you use, see their documentation for instructions.

Add the sensor in Open Dental in [Imaging Devices](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7imagingdevices.html). Make sure to check the box for *Show Twain UI*. If you attempted to take radiographs without this box checked, then you may need to check the box and restart Open Dental.

In the [Imaging Module](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7images.html), in the top Toolbar, create a new [Mount](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7mountdefinitions.html). Click Acquire.
