## Use in a Web Browser

Let patients complete forms and other checklist items from the convenience and comfort of home. eClipboard Web is a web-based alternative to the eClipboard app. Easily provide patients with a link they can access using their personal computer or mobile device.

## Key Features

In all versions of eClipboard (app and web-based), patients can:

* Fill out electronic intake forms via [Sheets](0_sheets.html) (patient registration, medical history, consent forms, etc.)
* Take photos that are uploaded to Open Dental (e.g., patient selfie, insurance card)
* View statements and make payments using the [Payment Portal](paymentportal.html)

In the eClipboard 24 and eClipboard 25 apps, patients can:

* Check into the Waiting Room when they arrive for their appointment
* Review and sign [Treatment Plans](0_treatmentplan.html)
* Review and sign [Payment Plans](0_paymentplan.html)
* Review and sign Consent forms

The following features are only available in eClipboard 25 and eClipboard Web:

* Updated interface
* Dark mode
* Accessibility options for font size and high contrast
* Electronic patient forms via [eForms](featureeforms.html) or [Sheets](0_sheets.html)
  + When utilizing [Sheets](0_sheets.html), forms can also be filled out via Web Forms or printed
  + When utilizing [eForms](0_eforms.html), forms are exclusively filled out using the eClipboard 25 app or eClipboard Web

Note: [eForms](0_eforms.html) are an alternative to Sheets that are optimized for usage on mobile devices. They are distinct from the Sheets feature, but both Sheets and eForms can be used in the eClipboard 25 app or eClipboard Web concurrently. eForms include conditional fields, which saves patient time by only including fields relevant to the patient. For more details, see [Digital Forms](featuredigitalforms.html).

Practices must be on support and have a unique, active registration key to [sign up](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7eservicessignup.html) for eClipboard. Practices must remain on support while using the service.

Features available in the app correspond with the Open Dental version and app version your office is using. We recommend using the eClipboard 25 app and eClipboard Web. Routinely update the app and Open Dental for the latest features and enhancements.
