ITRANS

For [Canada](canada.html) users, claims were submitted electronically through the ITRANS clearinghouse.

The Canadian Dental Association retired ITRANS 1.0 and moved all customers to ITRANS 2.0.
As of 3/31/2021, all new installations must be done with ITRANS 2.0.

See [ITRANS 2.0](itrans20.html). Contact Open Dental Support for assistance with the installation.
