Canada Carriers

Canadian carriers can easily be added and maintained, without manually creating each one.

For [Canada](canada.html) users, click Lists, [Insurance Carriers](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7carriers.html).

Insurance carriers marked as *CDAnet* are capable of sending electronic claims to ITRANS or Claimstream (TELUS).

Search criteria:

* **Carrier**: Search the list by carrier name.
* **ElectID**: Search the list by electronic ID.
* **Phone**: Search the list by carrier phone number.
* **Show Hidden**: Check to include carriers marked as hidden.
* **CDAnet Only**: Check to only show carriers marked as CDAnet.

Click **Refresh** to update the list.

To update the Carriers list, select the criteria and click **Update Carriers**. This button is for [ITRANS 2.0](itrans20.html) and [Claimstream](claimstream.html) users only. Carriers are updated based on the Electronic ID.

* **Address**: Update carrier addresses if no address is present.
* **Phone**: Update carrier phone number if no phone number is present.
* **Add Missing**: Add any missing CDAnet carriers (e.g., new carriers) based on carrier name and carrier ID. Carriers that share a carrier ID or don't support electronic claims need to be added manually.

Note: Regardless of whether any boxes are checked, the CDAnet information in the bottom half of each carrier is still updated when the Update Carrier tool is run.

Click **Add** to add a new carrier. Click **Combine** to [Combine Carriers](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7carrierscombine.html).

Double-click on a carrier to view carrier information and CDAnet information.

The Carrier information in the top half is editable by the office.

The information under *CDAnet* is maintained by the CDA.

* This information is updated when running the Update Carriers tool.
* If a server is entered in the Update Server field in [Preferences](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7preferences.html), the Supported Transaction Types are updated hourly.
