Conversion: Split Database

A database split may be necessary when one or more providers leave a practice and want to take data belonging to their patients with them. This can be done by provider or clinic. Database splits can also be performed to create a database template that copies all settings without copying patient information. See [Conversions](conversions.html).

### Database Split Process

1. **Call Us:** [**Contact Open Dental**](contact.html) to schedule a Test Database Split appointment. We recommend scheduling at least one to two weeks in advance of your desired conversion date.
2. **Test Split:** This process will give you a clear idea of how your data will look in the final conversion.
3. **Test Split Discussion:** A Conversions Specialist will review your test split with you in detail and discuss any questions or concerns.
4. **Test Split Checklist:** Prior to scheduling your final database split, you will need to review and verify the test split data and complete the [Database Split Checklist](../resources/conversions/Split%20Checklist.pdf).
5. **OpenDentImages:** Prior to completing the final split, you will need to decide how to handle the Open DentImages folder. There are three options:
   * **Option 1**: The dental office can copy the entire OpenDentImages folder from the original location to the new location for patient scans to be accessed.
   * **Option 2:** For a fee we can split out the scanned documents for only the patients in your database split.
   * **Option 3**: You can choose to not do anything with the scanned documents for the split database(s).
6. **Final Split:** Now you're ready to schedule and complete the final database split.

**Note:** Open Dental does not convert an office's digital imaging software (x-rays). Contact your digital imaging software for options regarding x-rays.
