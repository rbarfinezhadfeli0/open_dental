Windows Update

See [Computer Security](securitycomputers.html).

Windows updates contain essential security updates that help keep your computer protected from [Viruses](virus.html). Updates pertain to any Microsoft product, including operating systems and Internet Explorer. We recommend you install updates automatically.

Windows updates are outside of the scope of Open Dental support. Work with your IT Professional to set up and maintain Windows updates and security.
