**Referral Slips****:** Referral slips can be generated for any patient/referral combination. All data on the referral slip can be edited before printing, including fields initially generated from the database. Printout is archived for later viewing. Referral slips for different referrals can be set up ahead of time and can be completely customized. Background images can be used. Freehand drawing is supported. Referral slips can be simultaneously emailed to patient and/or referral as a pdf. [Referral Slips](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7referralslips.html).
