## Appointments GET Slots

Version Added: 21.1

For simple dental office setups. See also [Schedules GET](apischedules.html).

This is closer to how search behaves from within Open Dental instead of WebSched. This requires no advanced setup. It looks at open schedule times, whether the schedules are attached to a provider or an operatory.

There are, however, some differences between this and the Search in Open Dental. This returns entire open slots instead of a series of suggested appointment times or the first appointment time for each day. It also currently searches by entire appointment length instead of the XXX provider times on appointments. For providers assigned to a single operatory, the results will be the same as what a person would see if looking at the Appointments Module. If a provider has existing appointments in multiple operatories, it considers all of them as a whole and only returns slots that are available in all operatories for that provider simultaneously.

Most users will specify a **ProvNum** and an **OpNum**.

**Parameters:** All optional.

**date:** Search for a single day in "yyyy-MM-dd" format. Must be today or a future date. Default is the next 14 days.
**dateStart, dateEnd:** Search for a date range, inclusive of both dates, in "yyyy-MM-dd" format.
**lengthMinutes:** Ignores slots that are shorter than the supplied number of minutes.
**ProvNum:** ProvNum of a provider. Defaults to the Practice Default Provider.
**OpNum:** (Added in version 22.1) FK to operatory.OperatoryNum that the provider is assigned to.

**Example Requests:**
 GET /appointments/Slots?date=2021-02-15
 GET /appointments/Slots?date=2022-03-30&ProvNum=50&OpNum=16
 GET /appointments/Slots?ProvNum=1&OpNum=18&dateStart=2022-03-28&dateEnd=2022-04-01

## Appointments GET SlotsWebSched

Version Added: 21.1

Rarely used. Probably just use Appointments GET Slots instead. Offices must be subscribed to WebSched eServices.

This gets slots according to the existing logic used for WebSched existing patient or new patient. Customer must first have gone to Setup WebSched (Existing Patient or New Patient) and done all the setup, including creating Appointment Types and linking Appointment Types to WebSched. This all requires a fair amount of setup on the customer's end, but that restriction is usually preferred when patients are making their own appointments.

After calling this method, use Appointments POST WebSched to create a new WebSched appointment.

**date:** Search for a single day in "yyyy-MM-dd" format.
**dateStart, dateEnd:** Search for a date range, inclusive of both dates, in "yyyy-MM-dd" format. If no dates at all are supplied, the default is the next two weeks.
**ClinicNum:** Required if clinics are enabled. FK to clinic.ClinicNum.
**defNumApptType:** Optional. definition.DefNum where definition.Category=42 (NewPat) or 51 (ExistingPat). There must also be an appointmenttype linked to that DefNum and it must be set to be used in WebSched.
**isNewPatient:** Optional. Defaults to false. Should match the kind of **defNumApptType** that you use.

**Example Request:**
 GET /appointments/SlotsWebSched?dateStart=2021-02-15&dateEnd=2021-02-15&defNumApptType=326

**Example Response:**
 [
 {

## Appointments GET WebSched

Version Added: 21.3

Rarely used. Probably just use Appointments GET (multiple) instead.

Gets a list of all appointments, indicating which were made through the WebSched service. This is displayed in the **eServiceLogType** field as either "Recall", "NewPat", "ExistingPat", or "ASAP". Appointments not made through WebSched will have an **eServiceLogType** of "None".

**Parameters:** All optional.

**date:** Search for a single day in "yyyy-MM-dd" format.
**dateStart, dateEnd:** Search for a date range, inclusive of both dates, in "yyyy-MM-dd" format.
**DateTStamp:** String in "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss" format. Only returns appointments with a DateTStamp altered after the specified date and time.
**ClinicNum:** ClinicNum of a clinic.

**Example Requests:**
 GET /appointments/WebSched

## Appointments POST Planned

Version Added: 22.2.31

Creates a planned appointment for a patient, which appears in the Planned Appts tab in the Chart Module. See [Planned Appointments](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7apptplanned.html) for more detailed information.

Most dental offices require their appointments to contain procedures. However, if the ApptsRequireProc preference is not enabled, then this Planned Appointment's pattern will be set from the AppointmentWithoutProcsDefaultLength preference, if it is set.

Procedures are attached to the Planned appointment by either including an **AppointmentTypeNum** or an array of **procNums**. Obtain the ProcNums of the procedures being attached to the Planned appointment with ProcedureLogs GET.

**PatNum:** Required.
**AppointmentTypeNum:** This or **procNums** is required to add procedures. FK to appointmenttype.AppointmentTypeNum. Follows the same logic for adding attached procedures, pattern, and color as in Open Dental. The pattern will only be applied if **Pattern** is not specified in the request.
**procNums:** This or **AppointmentTypeNum** is required to add procedures. An array of ProcNums in [1,2,3] format. The pattern will be derived from the length of all procedures if **Pattern** is not specified in the request. Repeated ProcNums will be silently ignored.

**Pattern:** Optional. Time pattern in 5 minute increments. A string consisting of 'X' and '/' characters only. Patterns exceeding 9 hours will be trimmed down to 9 hours. Default "/XX/" (20 minutes).
**Confirmed:** Optional. definition.DefNum where definition.Category=2. Default is the first definition in that Category.
**Note:** Optional. Default blank.
**ProvNum:** Optional. Defaults to patient.PriProv, if it is set, or the dental office's default provider.
**ProvHyg:** Optional. Default 0.
**ClinicNum:** Optional. Defaults to patient.ClinicNum.
**IsHygiene:** Optional. Either "true" or "false". Default "false".
**IsNewPatient:** Optional. Either "true" or "false". Default "false".
**Priority:** Optional. Either "Normal" or "ASAP". Default "Normal".
**PatternSecondary:** (Added in version 23.3.17) Optional. Time pattern in 5 minute increments. A string consisting of 'X' and '/' characters only. Must match the length of **Pattern**. Defaults to a string consisting of "/" that spans the length of **Pattern**.

**Priority:** (Added in version 22.1) Either "Normal" or "ASAP".
**AppointmentTypeNum:** (Added in version 22.1) FK to appointmenttype.AppointmentTypeNum. Use 0 to indicate None. Follows the same logic for adding attached procedures, pattern, and color as in Open Dental. The pattern will only be applied if **Pattern** is not specified in the request.

## Appointments PUT Break

Version Added: 21.3

Breaks an appointment. Only appointments with an AptStatus of Scheduled can be broken. Creates a CommLog entry if the office has that preference turned on. To reschedule a broken appointment, use Appointments PUT (update) to update the **Status**, **AptDateTime**, and **Op** of the broken appointment.

**AptNum:** Required in the URL.

**sendToUnscheduledList:** Required. Either "true" or "false". Usually use "true" to send the broken appointment to the Unscheduled List. This will allow the patient or the office to see that this appointment is ready to be scheduled when they are ready. The only reason you would ever use "false" is if you were setting **breakType** to "Missed" or "Cancelled". "false" would leave the appointment in place on the appointment book.
**breakType:** Optional. Rarely used. Only used if you want a procedure to be added, which is usually associated with a fee. Use "Missed" to add a procedure with code D9986, indicating that they missed their appointment without notice. Use "Cancelled" to add procedure with code D9987, indicating less than 24 hrs notice. Normally, if more than 24 hrs notice is given, you would not specify **breakType**. These options cannot be used unless the offices has gone to Setup > Appointments > Appts Preferences, and changed the broken appointment procedure type to no longer be "None".

**Example Request:**
 PUT /appointments/5/Break

{
 "sendToUnscheduledList":"true"
 }

**Example Response:**
 200 OK
 400 BadRequest (with explanation)

The other four confirmVal options are managed by the office in eServices Setup > Automated Messaging.

**confirmVal:** Either "None", "Sent", "Confirmed", "Not Accepted", or "Failed".
