# Version 5.1

See [Versions](versions.html)

Released 9/7/07

**3D Graphics:** There were some slowness issues in version 5.0 which have all been resolved. In the rare case where there is a graphics issue, additional options have been added to the [Graphics Setup](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7graphics.html) window.

**E-Claims:** Tesia acknowledgement reports (997s) now automatically get attached to the claims so that status can be tracked better.

Single e-claims can be sent directly from claim edit window.
 Some enhancements to the UB04 medical claim form. (We support creation of UB04 claimform, but do not actually have one built).
 Users can be hidden by hiding the attached employee.
 Clearinghouse reports show in the main Send Claims window
 Dental School Requirements: Now allows multiple requirements to be filled on a single appointment. Can also be multiple students on one appointment.
