Patients can access the Patient Portal using most web browsers or mobile devices. On the login screen, patients can view office name and contact information, click a link to the [Payment Portal](0_paymentportalsees.html), and log in to the Patient Portal. Below is a summary of what the patient or authorized representatives may see when they go to the Patient Portal.

## Navigating Patient Portal

Patients can navigate Patient Portal by clicking the tabs at the top. Tabs can be included or omitted depending on the settings selected by the office. Patients can also view contact information for the practice or clinic, change their password, or view patient information for other family members.
