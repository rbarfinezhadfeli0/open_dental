Automation can be used for some of the following :

* Display a popup warning when a patient's insurance plan effective date ends.
* Display a popup warning for a patient who has a specific allergy or condition.
* Generate patient instructions when a specific procedure is completed (e.g., extraction).
* Automatically generate a letter when a patient misses their appointment.
* Automatically generate a letter to a referral source when a new patient schedules their first appointment.
* Restrict appointment scheduling when a patient has a specific billing type (e.g., collections).

## Setting Up Automation

Automation can be set up to occur when a specific action is complete (e.g., setting a procedure complete, creating claims, etc.)

Conditions (e.g., age, allergies, billing type, etc.) can be assigned to an automation so that it only occurs when conditions are met.
