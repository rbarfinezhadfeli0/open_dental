Network and Computer Setup

See [Documentation](documentation.html).

We recommend working with a networking professional to set up your network and computers. The following links may be helpful.

## Basic Setup

This guidance is targeted towards smaller practices (e.g., less than 20 workstations in a single location on a single network). For more advanced topics see below.

## Advanced Topics

Large offices and more complex networking situations may need to address additional issues. This applies to offices that use many computers (20+) in a single location, domains, multiple locations, multiple networks, VPNs, thin clients, virtualization, etc. These setups vary in complexity. Guidance for IT is provided below.
