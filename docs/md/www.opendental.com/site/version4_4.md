# Version 4.4

See [Versions](versions.html)

Released on 9/29/06

**Messaging:** Overhaul of the old messaging functionality. Send a text message to a user or group. Look at the message history. Chain messages together (examples: Jill-Family-Line1, or Dr-Urgent-Op2). Record your own sounds. Unique sound for each recipient so you don't have to look up unless the message is for you. Acknowledge messages. Customize the light grid with text and colors. Setup a different light grid for each operatory. Show lights on icon in taskbar.

**Rx Printing:** Choose between more orientations and printing behavior.

**Recall Improvements:** View by date range instead of number of days. Sped up loading by using a single query. Recall cards can be grouped by family. Postcards can be shifted on the paper to accomodate printers. When printing recall cards, commlog entries are made automatically.
