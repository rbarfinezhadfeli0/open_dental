Imaging Module

The Imaging [Module](0_modules.html) is a place to scan and store most images, radiographs, forms, and letters that are traditionally stored in a paper chart.

Open Dental supports native radiograph and image capture using supported sensors, intraoral cameras, webcams and scanners. See [Sensor Compatibility](sensorcompatibility.html), [Imaging Camera Compatibility](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7imagingcameracompatibility.html), and [Scanners](scanners.html) for additional information.

**Scan**: Easily scan single or multiple page documents. Use options for scanning radiographs or images to optimize how an image is scanned.

**Mount / Acquire**: Take radiographs using a connected sensor. Single or multiple images can be taken at once.

**Video**: Open a video feed for a connected intraoral camera or webcam. Easily capture an image from this window.

Note: An active registration key is required to utilize the Mount/Acquire and Video capture features to take images. The trial version, which does not use a registration key, can still be used to test these features as needed.

**Import**: Add an existing file from the current computer or network to Open Dental.

**Export**: Export the selected file to another location on the computer or network.

**Copy**: Copy the selected image to the clipboard, including drawings and annotations. Alternatively, click the dropdown to copy the image without the drawings or annotations.

**Paste**: Paste files or bitmaps from the clipboard into the selected mount position or image folder.

The secondary toolbar has options to edit image files.
