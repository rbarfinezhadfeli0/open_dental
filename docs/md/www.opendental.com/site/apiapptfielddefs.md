API ApptFieldDefs

See [API Specification](apispecification.html)

Appointment Field Defs allow you to organize notes specific to a patient's appointment and are displayed in the bottom left of the Edit Appointment window.

Anyone using the API should also become very familiar with our schema documentation which contains important details about individual database table columns.
 See [ApptFieldDef Database Schema.](SchemaRedirect%EF%B9%96apptfielddef.html)
