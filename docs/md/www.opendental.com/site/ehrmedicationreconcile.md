# EHR Objective 7: Medication Reconciliation

This information applies to EHR Modified Stage 2 for Program Years 2015 to 2018. For current information, see:

* [EHR Modified Stage 2](ehrmodified2.html)

**Measure**: Provider must reconcile a patient's Open Dental medication list with a list of medications received from another provider for more than 50% of transitions of care in which the patient is transitioned into the care of the provider. You can reconcile manually using a paper document or electronically using an imported summary of care file (ccd.xml file).

**Exclusions Available?**

Yes, if the provider does not receive any transitions of care during the reporting period.
