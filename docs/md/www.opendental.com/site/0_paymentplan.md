## Production Tab

The production tab is where you can attach procedures to the Payment Plan. The attached production will determine the amount of the Payment Plan. This also makes it easy to determine the repayment amount and ensure payment is attached to the correct treatment.

Both completed and treatment planned procedures, along with adjustments, can be attached to Payment Plans. As production is added, the Total Principal Amount is automatically calculated.

## Saving and Additional Options

Payment Plans can be saved and printed or sent to the [eClipboard](eclipboard.html) app to present to patients.
