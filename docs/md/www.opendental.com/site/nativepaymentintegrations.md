# Native Payment Integrations

Open Dental is integrated with three merchant service companies to process payments directly through Open Dental.

Open Dental works with vendors to develop and support Native Payment Integrations.

With a Native Payment Integration:

* Payments can be processed directly through Open Dental
* Payment details (e.g., credit card numbers or bank account information) can be saved to Open Dental to process future payments or recurring charges.
* Payments are automically posted to the patient account in Open Dental

## Integrated Options

Open Dental has native integrations with three payment processors. Prior to using an integrated payment method, your practice must first sign up with the merchant and enable the program link.

More than one credit card processing program may be enabled in Open Dental and clinics may set up different credentials when using different merchant accounts.
