Screen Size

See [Network and Computer Setup](computernetworksetup.html)

See [Computer Requirements](computerrequirements.html)

Minimum resolution required for Open Dental is 1280 x 768. This is less than an HD monitor, which is 1920 x 1080. Open Dental should work on most monitors and laptops, but if you have a very small laptop, do make sure that the screen resolution is at least 1280 x 768.

Note: When using 1280 x 768, you might need to hide the Windows taskbar in order to interact with certain features.

If your monitor resolution is a little higher than the minimum above, you can use the [Zoom](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7zoom.html) feature to make Open Dental easier to see.
