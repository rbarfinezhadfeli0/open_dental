# eServices

eServices are internet-based features available through Open Dental that can provide enhanced access for patients and providers, and automate many tasks.

The result is increased productivity and efficiency and a better patient experience, which translates into improved patient retention and practice growth.

### eService Fees

See [Fees for Software, Support, and Services](https://opendental.com/site/fees.html#eservices).
 To sign up, each location must be on support and have a unique, active registration key. Only customers on support will be able to sign up for any eService. Integrated Texting can still be utilized even if the office cancels support; in these cases, we will only provide support limited to the eService still in use. Practices must remain on support while using all other eServices.

### Other Details

* eServices require Installation of the eConnector, the gateway of communication between your computer and our secure servers.
* For a list of supported browsers, see [Computer Requirements](computerrequirements.html).
* Distributors who would like to resell Open Dental eServices, see [Distributors](distributors.html).
