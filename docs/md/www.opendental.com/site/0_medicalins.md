Open Dental has numerous features for medical insurance, making it useful in oral surgery and hospital settings.

Medical features can be enabled or disabled depending on your practice's needs.

## Insurance Plans

[Insurance Plans](0_insplan.html) can easily be marked as medical.

A medical claim form type (e.g., HCFA 1500, UB04) can be assigned as the default for any insurance claims for the plan.

## Cross Coding

Dental codes can be easily cross-coded to a medical code. This ensures the medical code is used on a medical claim without seperately charting the medical code.

## Procedures

Medical information can also be entered on a [Procedure](0_procedureedit.html) as needed.

This includes:

* Medical Code: When a procedure code is cross coded, this is automatically filled in. This can also be filled out manually.
* ICD Diagnosis Codes: Multiple ICD-10 codes can be used in conjunction with procedure codes and a code can be marked as the principal diagnosis.
* And more.

## Claims

Medical claims can be created using the New Claim dropdown from the [Account Module](0_account.html). When choosing a medical claim type, medical codes are automatically used for cross-coded procedures.

Claims can be printed to a medical claim form or sent electronically using a medical clearinghouse like Electronic Dental Services or Apex.
