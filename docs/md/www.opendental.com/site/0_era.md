Automatic download of ERAs is supported by the following clearinghouses:

* DentalXChange ClaimConnect E-Claims
* Electronic Dental Services
* Denti-Cal

ERAs from other clearinghouses or carriers can be manually downloaded to Open Dental.

Downloaded ERAs can be used to auto-populate insurance paid amounts into claims used to finalize insurance payments.

## Processing ERAs

ERAs can be automatically or manually processed.

### Automatic ERA Processing

There are two options for autoamtic ERA processing, depending on how your practice wishes to review the ERAs. Fully-Automatic ERA Processing automatically matches ERAs to a claim and finalizes payment. Semi-Automatic ERA Processing allows you to preview ERA information before it is finalized and associated claims can be finalized with a single click. Automatically processed ERAs are included in the ERA 835s list and can be reviewed or updated as needed.

### Manually processing ERA

When manually processing ERAs, you will review each claim and payment amounts before manually finalizing payment.
