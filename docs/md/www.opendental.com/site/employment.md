This opening is for the position of Teacher/Assistant Director at the Certified Child Care Center in Salem, Oregon called Growing Minds Childcare. The facility has a capacity of 100 children, from infant through preschool. The daycare serves both the employees of Open Dental Software and the community at large.

This position will primarily be focused on the Teacher role, but we are looking for someone who can support and back up the Director as needed.

Requirements: The requirements for a Teacher/Assistant Director in Oregon allow for various combinations of education and/or experience. For instance, 750 hours of qualifying teaching experience\* in a Certified Child Care Center, or comparable group care program\*\* in the appropriate age level would qualify an applicant as a Teacher/Assistant Director. To see the many ways to qualify, see page 35-36 of the Oregon rules at <https://www.oregon.gov/delc/providers/CCLD_Library/CCLD-0084-Rules-for-Certified-Child-Care-Centers-EN.pdf>.

The Teacher/Assistant Director will have the support of the company, Open Dental Software as well as the support of the Daycare Director. This means that there will be less responsibility in certain areas including budgeting, financial management, human resources, maintenance of building and grounds, janitorial, IT (computers, network, printers etc.), billing, etc. This will allow the Teacher/Assistant Director to focus more on areas specific to childcare. Also, whenever there's a problem, the parent is minutes away, relieving the center from many typical issues like child cleanup, sickness, isolation, etc.

One of the most important skills we're looking for is the ability to manage paperwork. There will be a lot of documentation of policies and procedures, as required by Oregon. There will always be an ongoing need to publish daily activities in advance for the different age groups. Strong computer skills and writing skills are helpful.
