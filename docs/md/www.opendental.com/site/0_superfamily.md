Super Family

In the [Family Module](0_family.html), super families can be used to group patients that are related in some way.

Super Families can be useful for various scenarios, inlcuding:

* Patients in a particular care facility (e.g., nursing home or retirement community).
* A split family due to divorce.
* Members of an athletic team getting mouthguards.

The Super Family feature can be enabled as needed.

In the [Family Module](0_family.html), easily create Super Family groups and add existing families or patients to the group. You can easily switch between families in the group.

In the [Account Module](0_account.html), switch between families in the Super Family group to view transactions. Statements can be created for individual patients, a single family, or the entire group.
