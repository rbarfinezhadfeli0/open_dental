# eRx Companies

Electronic Rx (eRx) is an internet-based, secure method of sending electronic prescriptions in Open Dental accessed from the [Chart Module](0_chart.html).

![](images/eRxCompanies.png)

There are two options for sending electronic prescriptions.

* [DoseSpot eRx](dosespot.html): eRx, EPCS, insurance coverage import, drug-drug, and drug-allergy interaction checks, ODMobile and ODTouch accessible, and alerts for pending prescriptions.
* [Ensora eRx](newcropfeature.html): eRx, EPCS, controlled compound drugs.

See [Fees for Support and Services](fees.html#erx) for pricing. Signing up for eRx initiates monthly fees that cannot be refunded.

eRx only works in the United States and its territories.

## EHR Incentive Program

ePrescribing with the EHR Incentive Program is only possible with [Ensora eRX - Comprehensive](newcropfeature.html).

## EMR / EPCS Implementation

Some states, such as Indiana, offer programs to reimburse users for EMR / EPCS Implementations. This does not apply to Open Dental as we have already gone through certification and implementation with our eRx providers. There is no implementation cost for eRx with Open Dental so there is nothing to reimburse.
