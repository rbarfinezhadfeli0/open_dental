# Version 5.7

See [Versions](versions.html)

Version 5.7 was released on 7/6/08.

**New Family:** A scripted window for handling incoming phone calls and quickly entering a new family. All family members, Ins, etc entered from one single window saves a lot of time and mouse clicks. Especially useful in pedo offices. [Family Add](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7familyadd.html).

PPO writeoffs: Alternative production reports that show writeoffs as applied on the day of service rather than on the day of the insurance payment. [Ins Plan Types](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7insplantypes.html).

Claims now have more fields for attachment quantities and types. The info (not the attachments themselves) will go out on both e-claims and paper claims. [Claim Edit](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7claimedit.html).

Appointments have a new field called TimeLocked. This checkbox can turn on or off the automatic time calculations. [Appointment Edit](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7aptedit.html).

Lab due dates now show on appointments.

Tooth ranges now show in Chart, Account, TP, and appointment edit windows.

TaskLists: Inboxes can be set for each user. Automatic refreshing now works for all lists. Reply button added. [Task List](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7tasklists.html).
