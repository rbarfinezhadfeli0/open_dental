Insurance Benefit Information

Open Dental offers highly customizable insurance benefits to accurately calculate procedure estimates and insurance remaining estimates.

In an [Insurance Plan](0_insplan.html), at the lower right, is the Benefit Information.

This area gives an overview of the benefits already entered for an insurance plan. Default percentages can be set for Insurance Categories, so you're not starting from scratch.

## Edit Benefits

The Edit Benefits window is where you can enter benefit information for annual max, deductible, coverage percentages, age limits, frequency limits, and more.

Use the Code Groups feature to create custom groups of procedures to use with benefits in addition to standardized Insurance Categories.

## Custom Benefits

For unique insurance benefits, you can use the Other Benefits feature. The Other Benefits area of the Edit Benefits window can be edited directly, or the Edit button can be pressed to open the Edit Benefit window.

Custom benefits can be added for things like patient-specific overrides, code-specific coverage, no annual max for a category, and more.
