HIPAA at Open Dental Software, Inc.

See [United States Regulatory Information](regulatoryinformationusa.html).

Below is a summary of how Open Dental Software, Inc addresses HIPAA guidelines and standards.

Open Dental Software, Inc. follows HIPAA guidelines and standards for security and privacy, implementing physical and electronic safeguards, including encryption. Open Dental software is a tool to help you become HIPAA compliant. It is up to you to make sure your practice is secure. See [HIPAA and Your Practice](hipaa.html).

**Open Dental Software, Inc. performs risk assessments**
 Open Dental Software, Inc. follows the NIST SP800-30 rev.1 protocol for risk assessments. This is the current, required protocol for analyzing potential PHI security risks. Following this protocol, we evaluate each risk's likelihood and impact, and implement security measures to address them. Open Dental actively reviews and edits a remediation checklist to document vulnerabilities and track the resolutions.

Our last Risk Assessment was completed on 08/21/2024. All risks (if any) were evaluated and addressed.

**Our HIPAA procedures and policies are up to date and available**
 Open Dental Software, Inc. requires all employees to be certified on our policies and procedures. Our documentation addresses and enforces the requirements of the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules and the HITECH Act.

**Employees are actively trained to properly handle PHI**
 Open Dental Software, Inc. has an effective training program that is regularly updated to ensure all employees are properly trained in the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules. Training is tracked internally. Open Dental Software, Inc. regularly audits all employees with access to PHI to ensure that data is properly handled, including but not limited to an annual audit plan. In the event of a disaster, Open Dental, Inc. is prepared to implement contingency operations and facility security plans.

**Open Dental Software, Inc. and PHI**
 In the process of providing customer support, Open Dental employees may be exposed to PHI, including but not limited to customer databases collected for debugging, troubleshooting or conversions; screenshots showing patient information; X12 files (insurance batch files); and EOBs. All instances of data transit used for customer support are HIPAA-compliant and encrypted. We do not use email for data transit because it is not HIPAA-compliant, even if using SSL. Email is not encrypted from the email server to the recipient. If data is stored for any reason it is encrypted.

**Business Associate Agreements**
 Open Dental Software, Inc. provides a standard [Business Associate Agreement](../resources/Business%20Associate%20Agreement.pdf). This agreement is for our customers whose PHI we many come in contact with. See [HIPAA and Your Practice](hipaa.html).

**Does Open Dental cache PHI or any data to local client hard drives?**
 No, Open Dental does not cache any PHI on local workstations ever. However, PHI may be intentionally written to the local hard drive for many 3rd party bridges and users can take actions that would put PHI on the local system. Examples and how to avoid if you do not want to treat workstations as containing PHI:

1. Bridge to imaging, patient name and birthdate might be written to a temporary bridge file: avoid by using Open Dental (instead of a third party imaging software that needs an local file) for your imaging and make sure the A to Z folder is on an encrypted drive on your server.
2. Insurance Clearinghouses using local files for transfer: avoid by using a clearinghouse, like DentalXChange, that uses secure https connections instead of local file transfer.
3. Printing a statement or treatment plan etc to a local file: avoid by not doing that.
4. Taking a screenshot and saving it locally: avoid by not doing that
5. Copying something from patient file and saving it locally or emailing it: avoid by using open dental's secure email product and attaching form A to Z folder instead of local files.

## A List of Things We Don't Provide

Open Dental Software, Inc. maintains documentation for internal use only. For security purposes we do not provide the following documents to the public:

* Name and contact information of our HIPAA Compliance Officer. Questions can be directed to *service@opendental.com* and will be answered accordingly.
* Names of employees performing work under Open Dental Software's Business Associate Agreement - Open Dental Software is simply too large to supply a full list of all employees that come into contact with PHI.
* The date of each employee's initial and subsequent HIPAA training - Open Dental Software is simply too large to supply a full list of all employee's date of training completion. Open Dental Software trains every employee to handle PHI, and recertifies every employee annually.
* Signatures by our HIPAA Compliance Officer or Security Officer - our employee's information is confidential.
* Filled questionnaires - Open Dental Software provides a standard list of answers that most offices require, on this page. We have thousands of customers. In order to review each questionnaire, we would need a legal team to read and respond to thousands of customers each year. If your state or office has specific requirements that are not listed in ours, we will add those sections as needed.
* Security Risk Assessment
* Remediation Plan
* HIPAA Master Policy and Procedure Manual
* Training Materials and Logs
* Network Vulnerability Scan
