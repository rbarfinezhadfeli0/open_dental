Commlogs can be created from various places in Open Dental (e.g., the main toolbar, the [Edit Appointment](0_apptedit.html) window, etc.)

A log of all Commlog entries is available in various areas of Open Dental, including the: [Account Module](0_account.html), [Edit Appointment Window](0_apptedit.html), [Chart Module](0_chart.html), and [Recall List](0_recalllist.html).

## Creating Commlogs

You can use commlogs to track communication with your patients. Commlog types can indicate what the communication is regarding, and can be customized to suit your practice's needs. Similar to [Procedure Notes](0_notes.html), these can include Auto Notes and Quick Paste Notes for convenience.

## Automatic Commlogs

Automatically-created Commlog entries that are not associated with a user, (e.g., [Automated Messaging](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7automatedmessaging.html)) are previewed as one line of text. These commlogs can be hidden in various areas.

## Navigation

Commlogs can include links to outside sources or other places within the program, such as [Wiki Pages](0_wiki.html), [Tasks](0_tasks.html), and more!
