## Userods GET

Version Added: 21.3

Gets a list of users (called userod since "user" is a reserved word in mysql). Users are separate entities from Providers and Employees, although they can be linked. A user can be a provider, an employee, both, or neither. CEMT users are not included.

**includeHidden:** (Added in version 22.4.24) Optional. Either "true" or "false". Set to "true" to return userods marked as hidden alongside those who are not hidden. Default "false".
**includeCEMT:** (Added in version 25.1.10) Optional. Either "true" or "false". Set to "true" to return userods that are designated as CEMT as well as those that are not. Default "false".

Returned fields are detailed below:

**userGroupNums:** (Added in version 25.1.10) An array of UserGroupNums, in [1,2,3] format.
**EmployeeNum:** Contains the employeeNum if the user is a employee. Otherwise, 0.
**employeeName:** The first and last name of the employee. Blank if user is not an employee.
**ProviderNum:** Contains the provNum if the user is a provider. Otherwise, 0.
