eForms are an alternative to [Sheets](0_sheets.html), designed exclusively for use with eClipboard 25 and eClipboard Web. They are optimized for tablet and mobile devices. eForms allow for dynamic fields, so patients only see the fields they need to fill, allowing for a more intuitive patient experience. Best of all, they are fully and automatically importable without any extra steps needing to be taken by the office staff. See [Digital Forms](featuredigitalforms.html) for additional details and comparisons.

## Editing eForms

Double-click an eForm to edit or click Add to create a new eForm. eForms are highly customizable.
