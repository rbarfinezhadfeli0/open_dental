Determine if the fee schedule is used for billed fees, fixed benefit amounts, and more. The Global Fees setting determines if fee overrides can be entered for specific providers or clinics, making it easy to use a single fee schedule even for specialists.

Once a fee schedule is created, fees can be entered from the Procedure Codes List.
