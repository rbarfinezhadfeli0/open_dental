A TSI interface is integrated with Open Dental so you can:

* Send past due accounts to TSI
* Manage accounts
* Suspend or cancel collections
* Accept payments directly through TSI

## Getting Started

Sign up with TSI and receive your TSI credentials: [tsico.com](https://www.tsico.com/alliances-opendental/). Once you're signed up, set up the TSI program link in Open Dental.

## Using TSI

The TSI interface can be used to find family guarantors that meet certain criteria, including minimum balance, day since last payment, and more.

You can easily select accounts to send to TSI. The Billing Type for accounts is automatically updated so accounts are easy to find. Once an account is sent to TSI, the company manages all billing and collection activity for the account.
