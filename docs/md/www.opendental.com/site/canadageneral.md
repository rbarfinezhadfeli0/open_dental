Canada Install and Setup

For [Canada](canada.html) users, see the information below to assist with setup and installation.

## General

To utilize all Canada-specific features, the [Region and Language](regionlanguagesettings.html) settings on all workstations must be set to *Canada*.

## Claims

The Canadian Dental Association (CDA) claim form is set as the default.

Claims needed for an American patient must be sent via a paper claim using the American Dental Association (ADA) claim form. We are not allowed to distribute the ADA claim form by law, so it must be purchased from the ADA instead.

Dentists who send electronic claims use [ITRANS 2.0](itrans20.html). Hygiene-Only offices who send electronic claims use [Claimstream](claimstream.html) (also known as the TELUS integration). Hygiene providers do not need to sign up with Instream.

## Tooth Numbering/Surfaces

In [Preferences](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7preferences.html), the *Tooth Nomenclature* preference is set to FDI Notation. Supernumerary teeth can be entered as 99.

In the United States:

* Valid tooth surfaces are MOIDBLF (facial). See [Enter Treatment](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7entertreatment.html).
* We use V to represent a class 5 location along the gingival margin of the B or F.

In Canada:

* Valid tooth surfaces are MOIDBLV (vestibular).
* Class 5 is represented by 5 instead of V to avoid confusion with vestibular.

## Clinics

If a practice is using the [Clinics](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7clinics.html) feature, make sure to use a different provider for each dentist/clinic combination. Each dentist is assigned an office number on the Edit Provider window. See, [Canada Provider Setup](canadaprovider.html). So if a dentist is at two offices, the only way to enter two office numbers is to use two separate providers.

## Privacy Laws

Open Dental only stores personal data for a short time when running conversions or for web forms not yet collected by the office. This information is encrypted, secure, and deleted after the amount of time required to perform the service.
