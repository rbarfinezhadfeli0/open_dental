# Version 4.6

See [Versions](versions.html)

Beta version released 12/29/06

**E-claims:** Table added to permanently record and track each electronic claim transaction (needed for Canada, but useful for everyone)

**Canadian E-Claims:** Significant progress has been made. Not done yet. See [Canada](canada.html).

**Fee Schedules:** Export function. Import function. Global update fees for all patients. Search and fix insurance plans with wrong fee schedules. Allow decreasing fees by a percentage. Compare three fee schedules while editing.

**General Accounting:** Automation of Retained Earnings, General Ledger Detail report, Acccounting Balance Sheet report.

**Oracle:** Built-in support for Oracle. (should be considered beta)

**Update enhancements:** The claim form and procedure codes can now be updated independently of the program itself.

**ADA 2006 ClaimForm:** This version is capable of importing and using the ADA 2006 claimform, although without a background. That download is freely available starting with 4.6.29. See [Update](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7update.html). In order to include the background, we need to wait for a licensing agreement with the ADA. That download will cost approximately $22. As a stopgap measure, we can mail blank claimforms to offices as needed.

**NPI:**  Included and functional with e-claims clearinghouses.

**1500 Claimform:** New medical claimform is supported, and a free update is available. It will be posted very soon.
