* **Appt Proc Quick Adds**: Easily chart procedures when creating an [Appointment](0_apptedit.html) by choosing from a customizable list of procedure combinations.
* **Add from Appointment**: When setting up an [Appointment](0_apptedit.html), easily treatment plan procedures that haven't been charted yet.
* **Auto Codes**: Auto Codes work behind the scenes to insert and validate the correct procedure code depending on a variety of conditions. These are customizable and can be helpful to ensure the correct procedure code is used for things like fillings, bridges, etc.
