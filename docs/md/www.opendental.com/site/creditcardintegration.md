Credit Card Integration

Open Dental is currently integrated with three different companies for [Credit Card Payment Processing](nativepaymentintegrations.html). Over the years, we have had well over 100 companies contact us requesting to be integrated, form partnerships, etc. Obviously, we cannot build 100+ different bridges.

If you are a representative from a payment processing company, and you wish to directly integrate your software with Open Dental, the answer is currently "no".
