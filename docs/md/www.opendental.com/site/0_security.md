Users, including a username and password, can be made for all employees and providers. Only specified users have access to edit security settings. Actions taken by users are logged in the [Audit Trail](0_audittrail.html) for easy tracking.

## User Groups and Permissions

User groups are a way to customize the permissions assigned to specified users. Users can be assigned to multiple groups making it easy to ensure users have only necessary permissions.
