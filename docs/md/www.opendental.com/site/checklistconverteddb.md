Post-Data Conversion Setup Checklist

See [Use Converted Database](usingodconversion.html)

This page is a guide to help ensure that Open Dental is set up properly after a data conversion. If you have a Post Conversion Setup appointment scheduled, most of the items listed will be addressed during that appointment. Our support team is also available to help with each of these topics.

In order to use the links on this page, access the Open Dental website using the [Help Feature](helpfeature.html).

Print this page to check off items as you complete them.

## Account Balances

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Compare A/R balance in Open Dental with A/R balance in old software. |

* Verify that the beginning total account balance in Open Dental is correct.
  + From your old software: Use the accounts receivable report, with credit balances included, run on the day of conversion.
  + In Open Dental: Run the [Aging of A/R](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7reportaging.html) report, include negative balances. If payment plans were converted, also run the [Payment Plans Report](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7reportpaymentplan.html) (don't limit by date range), then combine reports to get the total beginning account balance.
* Compare the total account balance in each report. They should match. Keep a copy of the reports for your records.
* Your aging report (0-30, 31-60, 61-90 day totals) will not be identical after your final conversion between Open Dental and your old software.
* Individual family member balances may not be identical to your old software after the final conversion is complete (even though the total family balances may be accurate).
