* **Paste Image**: Paste an image already saved to the clipboard.

## Attachment Process

1. Send the claim or predetermination as normal, without any attachments.
2. The response returns as an Acknowledgment. Attachments are generally not needed if the response returns an EOB or Rejection.
3. Navigate to the Canada Claim Attachments window.
4. Add images or files that are needed.
5. Click **Send Attachments**.

Attachments can be sent immediately after receiving the Acknowledgment response or much later if the attachments were requested by mail. Some carriers send the final approval EOBs directly to Open Dental as a mailbox item, see [Canada Claim History and ROT](canadaclaimsend.html).

To confirm sent attachments, view the *ClaimSend* permission in the [Audit Trail](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7audittrail.html).

Edits made using the [Draw](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7draw.html) tool are not reflected in the attachment when using the Import button.

Note: If attachments cannot be sent electronically, they can be mailed, or the carrier can be contacted for more submission options (e.g., the carrier's online portal, CDA SecureSend, BrightSquid, Fax, or Email).

## Setup

To utilize attachments:

* An image category must be marked as *Claim Attachments* in [Definitions: Image Categories](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7definitionsimagecat.html).
* The carrier must have a Supported Transaction Type of *Attachment*.
