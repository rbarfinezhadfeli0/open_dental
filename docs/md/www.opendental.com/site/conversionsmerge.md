Conversion: Merge Databases

A database merge is performed when the data from two (or more) databases needs to be consolidated into a single database (e.g., when combining multiple locations or buying out another practice). Merges can be performed on multiple databases, including when converting from another software. See [Conversions](conversions.html).

**Fees:** To see merge fees, visit our [Conversions](conversions.html) page.

**How it Works:**

* One database is marked as the *superior* database; the other(s) are marked as *inferior*.
* Sometimes there are values and settings that are present in both databases (e.g., practice address, default practice provider, etc.) In these cases, the *superior* database values are chosen over the equivalent values in the *inferior* database. Unique information (e.g., patient accounts, charting, etc.) will be present from all databases.

**OpenDentImages folders:** All scanned documents and images are stored in the [OpenDentImages folder (A to Z folder)](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7atozfolder.html). If there are multiple OpenDentImages folders (e.g., all locations already use Open Dental), the conversion team will require access to all OpenDentImages folders of databases being merged, at the time of the merge. We recommend storing the files on an external drive or directory.

**Patient Numbers and Digital Imaging Software:** During the merge, patients in the *inferior* database will receive new patient numbers to avoid duplication. If the digital imaging software you currently use utilizes patient number to open the patient's x-rays, patients must be renumbered in the imaging software. Open Dental can provide a spreadsheet of all patients and their patient numbers in the merged database.

## Database Merge Process

1. **Call Us:** [Contact Open Dental](contact.html) to schedule a Test Database Merge appointment. We recommend scheduling one to two weeks in advance of your desired merge date.
2. **Test Merge:** You will complete a test merge to get an idea of how your merged data will look in the final merged database.
3. **Test Merge Discussion:** A Conversions Specialist will review your test merge with you in detail and discuss any questions or concerns.
4. **Database Merge Checklist:** Prior to scheduling your final merge, you will need to review and verify the test merge and complete the [Database Merge Checklist](../resources/conversions/Merge%20Checklist.pdf).
5. **Final Merge:** Now you're ready to schedule and complete your final merge.
6. **Post-Merge Checklist:** Once the final merge has been completed, you will want to complete the [Post-Merge Checklist](../resources/conversions/Post%20Merge%20Checklist.pdf) to set up and clean up your newly merged database.

After two or more databases are merged and the resulting database has been in use, it is not possible to reverse the merge and revert the live database back to the original databases. Database merges are permanent.
