API Documents

See [API Specification](apispecification.html)

This includes images, PDFs, etc. There are four ways a document can be inserted into Open Dental:

1. Not using any API - Add a file to the patient folder. When the user later load the Imaging Module within Open Dental, any new files found are always recognized and entries are made in the database for them. By default, the new file will be dropped into the first category of images. If you want the new file to go to a specific category, then you can name it with a prefix of "\_##\_". Example: "\_135\_". The prefix number should be the DefNum of the category where the document belongs. To determine the DefNum, you will need to look in the database where definition.Category=18 and pick from that list somehow. Files with prefixes are processed to go into the specified category, and the prefix is removed.

2. Documents POST SetByUrl.

3. Documents POST Upload.

4. Documents POST UploadSftp.

Anyone using the API should also become very familiar with our schema documentation which contains important details about individual database table columns.
 See [Document Database Schema.](SchemaRedirect%EF%B9%96document.html)

## Documents POST DownloadMount

Version Added: 21.2

You probably don't want to use this. Gets all the individual images for one mount, but there's no information about which position in the mount, flipping, rotation, etc. It is much more common to use Documents POST DownloadSftp to get a composite image for a mount instead of the individual images.

This will place files on an SFTP site that you specify. After running this method, download the resulting files from your SFTP site. The user with the SFTP credentials must have write permission in this directory. Directory will be created if it does not exist, and files already existing with the same name will be overwritten. All file storage options (LocalAtoZ, InDatabase, and Cloud) are supported.
