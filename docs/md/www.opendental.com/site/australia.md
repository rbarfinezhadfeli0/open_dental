Australia

See [International Customers](countries.html).

Open Dental is currently being used in Australia by a few offices and it works well.

## Support

We generally provide email support to Australia because of the time difference. However, Australian customers are always welcome to call us during our normal business hours. It is easiest to reach us in the morning (Australian time) because it will be late afternoon on the U.S. west coast. For example, 10 AM Tuesday in Sydney is 5 PM Monday in Oregon. In an emergency, you may be able to reach someone as late as 3 PM Australian time. We have an Australia phone number listed on our [Contact Page](contact.html).

## Region and Language Settings

To see Australian features, such as custom address fields and statements, set the [Region and Language](regionlanguagesettings.html) on each workstation to *English (Australia)*.

## Statements

Provider name and number must show on statements. In the [Provider](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7providerseditwindow.html) edit window, set the provider number in the National Provider ID (NPI) field. It will then show automatically on statements.
