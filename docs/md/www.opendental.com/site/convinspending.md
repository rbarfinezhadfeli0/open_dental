Conversions: Verify Insurance

See [Use Converted Database](usingodconversion.html).

During a final [Conversion](conversions.html), we convert as much insurance information as possible. However, most conversions do not convert annual maximums, exact coverage on particular procedures, etc. This means users must manually verify and edit insurance benefit information for all patients.

To help offices track updates, we mark all insurance plans as Pending ([Edit Insurance Plan Window](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7insplan.html)) during the conversion. As users update plan information, uncheck the *Pending* box to indicate the insurance information has been updated.

To make the task manageable, we recommend starting with patients who have upcoming appointments.

Use the [Insurance Verification List](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7insverifylist.html) to see a list of patients with upcoming appointments who need to have benefits or eligibility verified.
