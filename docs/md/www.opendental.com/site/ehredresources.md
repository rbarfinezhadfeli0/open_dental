## Setup

[EHR Setup Education Resources and Triggers](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7ehrsetupedresources.html)

Patients must meet a defined criteria before an education resource will be triggered in the Education Resource window. When you set up triggers and education resources, be thoughtful of what you choose as criteria. Available criteria can be based on problems, medications, or lab orders. We suggest you set up multiple criteria options. You will need to provide resources to more than 10% of patients in the denominator, thus education resource criteria should be applicable to more than 10% of patients. Ideas for triggers:

* Education resource triggered for common dental problems such as dental caries, bad breath, etc.
* Education resource triggered based on a patient's tobacco use.
* Education resource triggered when patient has *no problems known* problem or no medications known medication.
