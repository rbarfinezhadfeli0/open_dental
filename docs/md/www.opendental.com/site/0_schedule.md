Schedules can also be viewed from the [Appointments Module](0_appointments.html). Provider schedules help determine operatory availability in the [Appointments Module](0_appointments.html) and when using the [Appointment Pinboard and Search](0_apptsearch.html) feature.

Filter by date range, employee or provider, and week type to update the schedules in the view.

Use the copy and paste tools to easily repeat existing schedules over multiple days or weeks.

## Edit Schedules

Set up the schedule for a day by adding start and stop times for employees and providers. This window can be opened from the Schedule window or [Appointments Module](0_appointments.html).

Easily switch to the previous or next day and search for a specific schedule. Add new schedules for one or multiple employees or providers and edit existing schedules as needed. Mark a day as a holiday to prevent schedules from being pasted into the date. Use the note feature to indicate vacations or other days the office may be closed.

### Graph Tab

In Schedule Setup, double-click a day. Click the Graph tab.
