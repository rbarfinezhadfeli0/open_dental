Blockouts

Blockouts are visual indicators on the schedule that can be used to indicate times for lunches, meetings, specific Appointment Types, etc.

In the [Appointments Module](0_appointments.html), Blockouts are displayed as colored areas.

Blockouts can be used to prevent scheduling at certain times, indicate the types of treatment to be scheduled in a time block, and more.

Blockout descriptions and colors are entirely customizable. They can appear on the schedule as a solid colored block or an outline.

## Edit Blockout

On the appointment schedule, right-click on a time block in an operatory, then click Edit Blockout or Add Blockout. From this window, you can adjust the blockout length, type, and attached operatories. You can also add a note to display on the schedule in addition to the blockout type description.

## Blockout Cut-Copy-Paste

You can easily copy and paste individual blockouts using right-click options from the schedule or use the Blockout Cut-Copy-Paste tool to copy and paste multiple blockouts over multiple days.

## Block Scheduling

Blockouts can be used in conjunction with [Appointment Types](0_appointmenttypes.html) to restrict users to scheduling certain treatment only during dedicated time blocks. Scheduling can be set up to be enforced by Appointment Types.
