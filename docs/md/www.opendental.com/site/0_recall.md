Recall

Customize a patient's recall interval, switch between prophy or perio recall, delete/disable a patient's recall type, or add custom types from the Recall grid.

In the [Family Module](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7family.html) at the top is the Recall grid.

This area displays information about the patient's recall, including due dates and scheduled dates.

Recall is automatically assigned to patients when certain procedures are set complete.

## Recall Setup

From the Setup menu, recall types, including default procedures, are entirely customizable. Default recall types are included when Open Dental is installed and additional recall types can be created as needed (e.g., for specialty practices or procedures).

## Recalls for Patient

Individual recalls can also be customized for a specific patient.

* **Recall Interval**: This automatically populates the default interval set for this recall type. If the specific patient requires a different interval, due to insurance limitations requiring more frequent care, etc., this can be customized.
* **Calculated Due Date**: The recall due date based on the Previous Date plus the recall interval.
* **Actual Due Date**: Typically the same as the Calculated Due Date but may be changed. This can be helpful if the patient was seen for their recall outside of your office after their last recall visit with you.
* **Time Pattern Override**: Create a custom appointment length for this patient when scheduling their recall.
* **Administrative Note**: Add notes about this patient's recall. This is also displayed in the [Recall List](0_recalllist.html).

**Disable Recall**: Prevent a patient from showing on the [Recall List](0_recalllist.html) by disabling their recall permanently, until a balance is reduced, or until after a specific date.
