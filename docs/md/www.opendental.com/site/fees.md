Fees for Support and Services

Open Dental Software's only upfront cost is the first month of support fees. Fees vary depending on number of locations, number of providers, and any additional functionality required. Monthly support fees include:

* The software.
* Updates as they are released.
* Phone, chat, and email technical support with our experienced techs (up to two specific issues per call).

After the initial contract, fees automatically continue on a month to month basis. Most users remain on the support plan so that they can continue to receive new version updates and telephone support.

 Data conversion from other software is not included. See [Data Conversion](conversions.html) for fees.

### Q & A

**Question:** I am using Open Dental at multiple treatment locations but using just one database (or remoting to one location to enter data). Do I have to pay a monthly support fee for each location/office?
**Answer:** Yes. Our policy clearly states that fees are per location/office.

**Question:** Do Software Support fees ever increase, and how often?
**Answer:** Small fee increases happen every few years. Fee increases from the original 2003 prices of $139 (first year) and $99 (13th month onward) have happened in 2008, 2015, 2018 and now 2022. Open Dental is committed to keeping prices low. The 2003 prices adjusted for inflation as of November, 2021 would be $208.94 and $148.82 (respectively, source (<https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/>)). The current (2022) prices are about 14% and 13% (respectively) less than they were in 2003, adjusted for inflation. We will probably continue to change prices every 3-5 years, but try to keep the price increases below inflation.
