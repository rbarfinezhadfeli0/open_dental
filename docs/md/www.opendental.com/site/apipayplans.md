API PayPlans

See [API Specification](apispecification.html)

Prior to 23.3.1, Open Dental users had the ability to create both Patient Payment Plans and Dynamic Payment Plans. The API supported these with PayPlans POST (create) and PayPlans POST Dynamic, respectively. In version 23.3.1, Open Dental deprecated Patient Payment Plans, renaming them to Old Payment Plans in the UI. The PayPlans POST (create) method was also deprecated at that time. Dynamic Payment Plans are now referred to simply as Payment Plans in Open Dental, and can still be created with the PayPlans POST Dynamic method.

Anyone using the API should also become very familiar with our schema documentation which contains important details about individual database table columns.
 See [PayPlan Database Schema.](SchemaRedirect%EF%B9%96payplan.html)
