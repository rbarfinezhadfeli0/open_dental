# Digital Forms

Open Dental offers two options for digital forms, eForms and Sheets.

## eForms

eForms use an intuitive interface that is optimized for mobile devices. They are compatible with the eClipboard 25 app and eClipboard Web.

eClipboard Web allows patients to fill out forms prior to their appointment from the comfort of their own home and their own device. eForms can be prefilled with patient information and can contain conditional questions. This makes it quick and simple for patients to only update the information they need to.

eForms make data entry a breeze when insurance plans, allergies, medications, and more can be automatically imported into your database.

For more information on eForms, see [eForms Feature](featureeforms.html). For more information on eClipboard 25 and eClipboard Web, see [eClipboard Feature](eclipboard.html)

## Sheets

Sheets are used for a variety of forms, including patient forms, letters, exam sheets, and more. These are primarily designed for print, but a mobile layout can be created for patient forms. Patients can use the Web Forms or eClipboard Web feature to fill out Patient Forms and Medical History forms online prior to their appointment.

Web Forms do not support conditional questions or prefilling patient information. Web Forms can only be created with Patient Form or Medical History Sheet types

Sheets allow for manual importing of information to the database, such as insurance plans, medications, allergies, and more.

For more information on Sheets, see [Sheets Feature](0_sheets.html).

For more information on Web Forms, see [Web Forms Feature](webforms.html).
