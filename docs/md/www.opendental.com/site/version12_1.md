# Version 12.1

See [Versions](versions.html)

Version 12.1 was released on 3/21/2012.

**Clinics:** Default clinics for patients based on user currently logged in. [Clinics](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7clinics.html).

**Replication Monitor:** This only applies to the few offices that use replication. If replication fails, Open Dental now responds by preventing further use of the slave database. [Replication](replication.html).

**QuickBooks:** Deposits can be automatically sent to QuickBooks. [QuickBooks](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7quickbooks.html).

**Minor Changes**
 Fees Can be entered directly in the grid in the Procedure List window, and the Enter key can be used instead of the mouse. Aka 10-key entry.
 Timecard day of week used for overtime calculations can be customized.
 Quickpaste notes available on pop ups.
 Claim field for custom tracking.
 Patient merge now handles custom patient fields better.
