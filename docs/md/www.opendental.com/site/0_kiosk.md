When a patient is ready to fill out forms on the Kiosk, staff can easily load the forms from another workstation using the Kiosk Manager.

## Using the Kiosk

Once forms are loaded for the Kiosk, users can send them to another computer that has the Kiosk open or they can launch the Kiosk on the current workstation from the Forms window.

The patient can then select and fill out forms from the Kiosk device. This includes registration forms, consent forms, and more. Once forms are filled out, they are automatically attached to the patient's account in Open Dental and information can be imported as needed.
