Linux and Mac

The information below is useful to those interested in running Open Dental in a [Linux Server](linuxinstall.html) or Mac OS environment.

## Open Dental on the Server

The Open Dental server can always be Linux (tested) or macOS (not tested).

The server needs to be able to host the MySQL/MariaDB server and the image files, but does not need to be able to run Open Dental itself.

* Unlimited computers can connect to the database on an ordinary Windows workstation, despite Windows limitations.
* To get around the computer limit for the [A to Z Folder](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7atozfolder.html) (i.e., OpenDentImages), simply get a network-attached hard drive.
* See [Computer Requirements](computerrequirements.html) for more information on maximum number of simultaneous connections, depending on Windows version.

## Running the Open Dental Client on Workstations

The Open Dental client program cannot run on Linux or Mac OS.

Mac users may be interested in these tools that run Windows.

* [Parallels](http://www.parallels.com/): Run Windows in a virtual machine inside Mac OS.
* [Bootcamp](https://support.apple.com/boot-camp): Boot up the Mac with either Mac OS or Windows.
