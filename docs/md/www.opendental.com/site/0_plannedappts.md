Planned Appointments

Planned appointments can be useful to set up and track a patient's next appointment for treatment planned procedures (e.g., RCT, crowns, fillings).

In the [Chart Module](0_chart.html), click the **Planned Appts** tab.

Planned Appointments can be beneficial to streamline the process and eliminate guesswork while scheduling a patient's next appointment. Appointments can be set up and assigned a length, notes, provider, procedures, etc., but do not have to be scheduled immediately. The [Planned Appointment Tracker](0_plannedtracker.html) can be used to follow up on these appointments.

You can create planned appointments from the [Chart Module](0_chart.html) or the [Treatment Plan Module](0_treatmentplan.html). Once a patient is ready to schedule, appointments can be quickly sent to the [Appointment Pinboard](0_apptsearch.html).
