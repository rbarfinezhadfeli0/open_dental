On Window 8 Surface Pro tablets, the kiosk doesn't take up the whole screen. The writing can appear very small to patients and the orientation can also be shifted by movement of the tablet. * Tablets need to have their keyboard undocked when filling forms. Docked keyboards may resize the full screen windows and can cause issues with scroll bars. * Tablets need to be in tablet mode for the touch keyboard to automatically popup when using the kiosk. * Tablets are very portable and can easily be lost or misplaced in a reception area setting. |
