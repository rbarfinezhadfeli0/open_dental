Notes can be added to a single procedure from the [Procedure Info](0_procedureedit.html) window. Notes can be added when a procedure is still treatment planned or after it has been set complete. These notes can be electronically signed or stamped.

Additionally, the Group Notes feature can be used to add a single note for multiple procedures.

In the [Chart Module](0_chart.html), highlight multiple procedures for a patient. Right-click and select **Group Note**.

### Chart Letters

Can be used for longer notes, typically oral surgery. These notes are written in a Word document which is easily accessible from the Chart Module and warns a user if the notes have been edited externally.

## Note Templates

The Auto Notes and Quick Paste Notes features can be used to easily input commonly-used note information.

### Auto Notes

Place cursor in a Procedure Note box. Above the box, click Auto Note.

Auto Notes are most useful for longer form notes that require input (e.g., SOAP notes).

These notes both input text and prompt for additional information. Prompts can be set up to allow you to choose from a preset list of options or enter free-form text. Auto Note templates and prompts are customizable.

### Quick Paste Notes

In the Main Menu, click Setup, Quick Paste Notes.

Quick paste notes are useful to easily insert text. Abbreviations can be assigned to a Quick Paste Note so that when you type the abbreviation (e.g., *?dlb*), the full note is added. Alternatively, in many text boxes, you can right-click to open a list of Quick Paste Notes and select a note to insert.

## Appointment Module Notes

There are various ways to add notes that appear in the [Appointments Module](0_appointments.html) or on an individual [Appointment](0_apptedit.html).

### Appointment Notes and Fields

There is a Note area in the [Edit Appointment](0_apptedit.html) window. This allows you to add additional appointment information that can be displayed on the appointment from the schedule.
