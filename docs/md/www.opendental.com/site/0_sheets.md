Sheets can include static text, images, information from the database, input fields, checkboxes, signature boxes, and more. This allows you to set up sheets that can be easily printed with specific information or that can be filled out as needed.

## Filling Out a Sheet

In the Main Toolbar, click **Forms**. Double-click an existing form to edit.

Sheets can be filled out by using the [eClipboard App](eclipboard.html), [Web Forms Feature](webforms.html) feature, a [Kiosk](0_kiosk.html), or by printing the form out. Forms for office use (e.g., Exam Sheets, Screenings, etc.) can also be filled out within Open Dental.

Once filled out, a sheet can be reviewed, printed, saved to the [Imaging Module](0_images.html). For forms filled out electronically some information (e.g., contact information, allergies, etc.) can be directly imported into the patient's account.
