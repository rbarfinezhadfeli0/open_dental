## ProcNotes POST

Creates a new note that is associated with a procedure. If the Procedure Note contains 50 or more consecutive blank lines, they will be removed.

To sign a procnote set **isSigned** to true. The signature that appears on the procnote will be shown as the following: "Digitally Signed by [API DeveloperName] Date Signed: ["MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss tt"]". See [API Implementation](apiimplementation.html) for more information on API Signatures.

**PatNum:** Required.
**ProcNum:** Required. ProcNum of the procedure.
**Note:** Required. The actual note.
**isSigned:** (added in version 24.2.29) Optional. Either "true" or "false". If "true", will digitally sign the procnote. Default "false".
