API ClaimPayments

See [API Specification](apispecification.html)

ClaimPayments are complex. They are used to finalize the payments received by insurance for a claim. See [Claim](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7claimedit.html), [Receive Claim](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7claimreceive.html), and [Finalize Insurance Payment](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7claimpayfinalize.html) for more details.

Anyone using the API should also become very familiar with our schema documentation which contains important details about individual database table columns.
 See [ClaimPayment Database Schema.](SchemaRedirect%EF%B9%96claimpayment.html)
