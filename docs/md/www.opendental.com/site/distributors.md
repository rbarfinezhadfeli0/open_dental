Distributors

Prior to Version 24.4, Open Dental had an open source GPL license that allowed other companies to package, sell, and support the software on their own. This is no longer possible with newer versions. We're not really sure what those other companies will do moving forward. At least for a while, we expect that they will continue to support Version 24.3, the last available GPL version.

### Suppliers and Consultants in the Dental Industry

If you are a supplier or consultant to those in the dental industry and have customers who would benefit from Open Dental, please refer them to us for the purchase of software. This includes:

* Computer IT networking and support companies
* Hardware consultants: You would assist with hardware and networking. We would provide software support.
* Equipment and supply dealers
* Dental Integrators
* Consultants
* Supplemental software vendors (e.g., clearinghouses, digital imaging, appointment reminders, patient communication, etc.)

The customer would contact us for software and support, but contact you for other services. For installation issues, we can work together to make it easier for the customer.

### Foreign Countries

For distributors in other countries, see [Foreign Countries](countries.html). Because of time zone and language differences, we are not able to provide extensive support to dental offices in many foreign countries. Local software developers sometimes fill the gap by distributing and supporting older open source versions Open Dental themselves.
