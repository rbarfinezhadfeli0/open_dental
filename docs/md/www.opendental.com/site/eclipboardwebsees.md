# eClipboard Web: What Patient Sees

On a web browser, go to the [eClipboard](eclipboard.html) Web URL.

eClipboard Web allows patients to fill forms online from any web browser. It is nearly identical to eClipboard 25 but does not allow for patient check-in, nor does the practice need to enter office login credentials.

eClipboard Web is an updated alternative solution to Web Forms.

## Patient Login

Patients log in using their first name, last name, and date of birth.

To verify their identity, they must also enter the phone number or email address associated with their patient account in Open Dental. A code is immediately sent to the entered selection.

## Patient Verification

After the patient enters the Verification code, they are directed to the checklist to complete needed items.

For a look at other eClipboard examples, such as the check-in list, filling eForms, and more, see: [eClipboard 25: What Patient Sees](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7eclipboard25sees.html).
