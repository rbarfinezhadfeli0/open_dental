# eForms: What Patient Sees

eForms are dynamic forms designed for use in eClipboard.

On a tablet device, open an eForm via the [eClipboard](eclipboard.html) 25 app.

Alternatively, open an eForm via [eClipboard Web](eclipboardwebsees.html).

eForms can be set up to be dynamic, so only fields relevant to the patient are displayed.

* Use the **Accessibility** button in the upper right to select the font size, display mode, and contrast mode.
* Use the **Previous** and **Next** buttons to navigate the form.

### Conditional Questions

eForms allow you to set conditional logic for questions, making it easy to show patients only the questions that are relevant to them.

For example, in a Registration Form, if a patients answers "No" to the question "Do you have dental insurance", any fields related to insurance are hidden. If they answer "Yes", then they'll be shown fields to enter their insurance information.
