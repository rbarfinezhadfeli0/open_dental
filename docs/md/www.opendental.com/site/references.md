Customer Reference

If you would like to speak with a current Open Dental user prior to purchasing Open Dental, please contact us for a reference. We will attempt to find a couple references for you to contact. Often we can narrow references to users in your geographic area, or to users who share your specialty or are of a similar size (e.g., multiple locations).

We do not contact offices to let them know we have supplied them as a reference. Please understand that they may be busy and explain you are calling to talk about their experience using Open Dental.

We choose offices who are currently on Open Dental support, and usually those who have used Open Dental for a longer period of time. If you would like to opt out of being a possible reference, please let us know.

**Reference Guidelines**

* We do not supply references for third party software or services (e.g., digital imaging, clearinghouses, bridges, etc.).
* We do not track 'public health' offices so cannot provide a public health reference.
* We do not give references to non-dentists.
