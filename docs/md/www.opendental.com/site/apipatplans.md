API PatPlans

See [API Specification](apispecification.html)

A PatPlan row in the database indicates coverage aka eligibility. If there is no patplan row, then the patient does not have coverage. So eligibility can be set by adding or removing PatPlan rows.

Anyone using the API should also become very familiar with our schema documentation which contains important details about individual database table columns.
 See [PatPlan Database Schema.](SchemaRedirect%EF%B9%96patplan.html)

## PatPlans POST (create)

Version Added: 21.1

This adds a PatPlan row to the database.

**PatNum:** Required.

**Ordinal:** Optional with a default of 1. This is a single digit numeric field (example: 1, 2, 3...). It represents the primary insurance, secondary insurance, etc. 0 is not used. If Ordinal is set to1, and there is already primary insurance, the other insurance will get bumped to Ordinal 2.
**Relationship:** Optional. Default is Self. Values can be "Self", "Spouse", "Child", "Employee", "HandicapDep", "SignifOther", "InjuredPlantiff", "LifePartner" or "Dependent".
**PatID:** Added in 21.4. Optional. A patient ID which will override the subscriber ID on eclaims. Also used for Canada.
