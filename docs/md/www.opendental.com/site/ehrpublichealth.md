The EP is in active engagement with a public health agency to submit electronic public health data from the CEHRT, except where prohibited and in accordance with applicable law and practice.

**Measure Option 1 - Immunization Registry Reporting** Provider is in active engagement with a public health agency to submit immunization data.

**Exclusion?**

Yes, if provider doesn't administer vaccinations or operates in a jurisdiction that doesn't accept immunization data from EP.

**Measure Option 2 - Syndromic Surveillance Reporting** Provider is in active engagement with a public health agency to submit syndromic surveillance data.

Exclusion? Yes, if provider is in a category of providers from which syndromic surveillance data is not collected or operates in a jurisdiction in which no public health agency is capable of or ready to receive syndromic surveillance data.

**Measure Option 3 - Specialized Registry Reporting** Provider is in active engagement to submit data to a specialized registry.

**Exclusion?**

Yes, if provider does not diagnose or treat any disease or condition associated with a specialized registry, or operates in a jurisdiction where no specialized registry is capable of or ready to receive electronic registry data.

Note: It is possible that dentists will meet exclusion criteria for all public health measures. Even if you intend to claim an exclusion, you may need to sign participation agreements or addendum's. For a full list of public health agencies by state, see <http://www.aphl.org/programs/informatics/Pages/MU-Public-Health-Readiness.aspx>.
