# Web Sched Recall: What Patient Sees

See [Web Sched Feature](websched.html).

   * Patients can select a date and time from provider available times. The options shown to the patient can be controlled by the Web Sched Recall settings. You can also allow the patient to select a provider.
   * The patient can also request to be notified if an earlier appointment time becomes available. This will add them to the [ASAP List](0_asaplist.html).
3. Click **Finalize Appt**.
4. A confirmation message shows for the patient to click **Yes** or **No**.
