Conversions

![](images/conversionSiteHeader.png)

If you would like to switch from another dental software to Open Dental, we provide a variety of conversion services:

* Data Conversions: Convert a database used by other software to an Open Dental Database
* Image Conversions: Convert scanned documents and patient pictures from another software for use in Open Dental
* Database Merges: Combine multiple databases into a single database.
* Database Splits: Create separate databases from a single database.
* And more: Our conversions team offers additional services, including custom conversion scripts, to get the most out of your data.

Fees vary depending on the software you are converting from, conversion service, and other factors. See the Conversion Services table below for details.

Since we cannot collect a copy of your data, we would need to attempt to run the data conversion on one of your computers so that the data will not leave the country/province. Because of the added complexity, the data conversion quote will have higher fees. Please contact the Open Dental Conversion Department to discuss your options. |

## Questions and Answers

**When do I need to make the payment for my conversion?**
 The conversion fee is separate from the support fee. The first month's support fee and final data conversion fee must be paid before the date of the final conversion. Call us at least 3 days prior to the conversion date to [make a payment](submitpayment.html). To pay by check, you can pre-arrange to have a statement sent to you.

**What happens to my conversion data after the conversion is complete?**
 By default, we retain a copy of test and final conversion data in a secure and encrypted location for approximately two months so we can provide assistance to customers if issues arise. Once two months have passed, the data is permanently deleted. If you would like to increase or shorten the length of time data is retained, please notify us in writing via email.
