# Open Dental Cloud

Open Dental Cloud is a hosted solution managed by Open Dental Software.

Open Dental Cloud looks and feels just like our local version, but can be accessed using a browser. To see if Open Dental Cloud is right for your office, give us a call. Our team will reach out to discuss the next steps.

Note: Open Dental Cloud is only available for US customers. The service is currently in limited release. We accept a limited number of customers requesting the service and give preference to those whose situation is a good match. There are some limitations on interoperability with third-party solutions.

The total monthly cost for Open Dental Cloud varies depending on the needs of the practice. An official quote will be provided before signup.

## FAQ

**How is cloud data protected?**

Each customer's database and A to Z folder (where documents and images are stored) are backed up periodically. The backups are encrypted, tested for integrity nightly, and stored off-site. See [Open Dental Cloud Backups](opendentalcloudbackups.html) for more information.

**What happens in the unlikely event of an Open Dental Cloud server failure?**

In the event that the Open Dental Cloud server fails, the most recent backup will be restored to a new server by Open Dental staff.
