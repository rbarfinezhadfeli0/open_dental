# Web Forms Feature

Web Forms are an [eService](eservices.html) that allows a patient to fill out and submit forms online using any online browser.

* Patient Forms and Medical History [Sheets](0_sheets.html) can be used as Web Forms. This includes things like:
  + Patient registration forms
  + Medical histories
  + Financial and HIPAA agreements
* Patients can fill out forms using a link you provide them.
* Forms are matched to existing patients and can easily be attached to a patient if no match is found.
* Data entered on forms (e.g., patient information, allergies, etc.) can be imported into the Open Dental database.

## Getting Started

The Web Forms feature is available at no additional fee for practices on support with a unique, active registration key. There are two options to create a Web Form:

* Have Open Dental convert your forms for you. See [Fees](fees.html#customsheets).
* Design the form yourself from [Sheets](0_sheets.html)

Once your form has been created as a Sheet, add the sheet to *Available Web Forms* in Web Form Setup and construct a URL. The URL can then be shared with patients via email, a link on your website, and more.

## How it Works

## What Patients See

Patients can fill out Web Forms on a computer, tablet, or phone. When using the Mobile Layout, sheets are optimized on mobile devices.
