Scan X

See [Sensor Compatibility](sensorcompatibility.html)

Air Techniques ScanX works with Open Dental version 21.3.29 or later.

Note: In our testing, the ScanX has issues when switching Windows users. We have had the scanner show as not present. A customer has separately reported that Open Dental can lock up and sometimes lose an image. We recommend not switching Windows users on the ScanX machine. Consider setting up a Windows user for that machine that is set with a longer timeout before it logs out of Windows. Also consider setting that user to have less network permissions and a password that everyone knows, so even if it times out, users would still go back into the same Windows user. Logging into Open Dental would still involve separate Open Dental users.

Utilize a [Mount](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7mountdefinitions.html) with *Flip on Acquire* enabled, otherwise images must be flipped manually after scanning.

1. In [Imaging Devices](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7imagingdevices.html), add a Device.

3. Check **Show Twain UI**.
4. In the [Imaging Module](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7images.html), in the top Toolbar, create a new Mount. Click **Acquire**.
