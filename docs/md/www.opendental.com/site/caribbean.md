Regional Licensing Issues

See [International Customers](countries.html).

In the Caribbean and Pacific Islands, it can be hard to determine whether a location is within, or outside of, the United States (U.S.)

Open Dental software is covered by two licenses, one of which is the ADA license. That license allows us to include the ADA procedure codes for distribution within the United States only. The ADA license specifically addresses this as follows: The United States version of Open Dental may be distributed in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealths of Puerto Rico, and the Northern Mariana Islands or any territory of the United States.

Based on this wording, we have developed a list of locations.

**Within the United States for licensing purposes**:

* 50 States
* Washington DC
* Puerto Rico
* Northern Mariana Islands
* Guam
* US Virgin Islands
* American Samoa

**Outside of the United States for licensing purposes (see [International Customers](countries.html) on opendental.com)**:

* Cayman Islands
* Bermuda
* British Virgin Islands
* Bahamas
* Jamaica
* Trinidad and Tobago
* All other locations
