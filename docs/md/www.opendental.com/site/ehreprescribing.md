# EHR Objective 4: ePrescribing

This information applies to EHR Modified Stage 2 for Program Years 2015 to 2018. For current information, see:

* [EHR Modified Stage 2](ehrmodified2.html)
* [2019 Program Requirements - Medicaid](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/EHRIncentivePrograms/2019ProgramRequirementsMedicaid.html)
* [Open Dental EHR](https://opendental.com/site/ehrlicense.html)

Measure: More than 50% of permissible prescriptions written by the provider are queried for a drug formulary and transmitted electronically (eRx).

**Exclusions Available?**

Yes.

1. Provider writes less than 100 permissible prescriptions during the reporting period.
2. Provider does not have a pharmacy in their organization, or there are no pharmacies that accept electronic prescriptions within 10 miles their practice location.

Note: EHR providers in New York must sign up for the comprehensive version of eRx so that drug interaction checks and formulary checks are enabled when orders are created. Because the state requires that you prescribe electronically, you do not qualify for the e-prescribing exclusion even if you write few prescriptions.

## Calculations

Rx:

* Denominator: All permissible prescriptions the provider made during the reporting period.
* Numerator: Prescriptions in the denominator transmitted electronically by the provider during the reporting period.

Controlled Substances: At this time, controlled substances prescriptions are not considered permissible prescriptions.

Drug Formulary: CMS recommends you capture and save one or more dated screenshots of formulary checks during the reporting period as supporting documentation.
