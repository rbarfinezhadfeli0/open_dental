Computer Security

See [Computer and Network Setup](computernetworksetup.html).

Security for computer systems is a multi-faceted issue that is essential for [HIPAA](hipaa.html) compliance and data protection. Addressing these issues correctly from the start prevents issues later on.

When considering how computer systems are configured, practices need to address security in three areas:

**Network Security**: For the security of the network, practices need to address:

* [Firewall](firewalls.html)
* [MySQL Security](securitymysql.html)
* [Share A to Z Folder](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7atozshare.html)

**Computer Security**: For the security of computers, practices need to address:

* [Windows Update](windowsupdates.html)
* [Network Users](networkusers.html) (user names/passwords for Windows)
* [Antivirus](virus.html)
* [Encryption of Data at Rest and in Transit](encryption.html)
* [Backups](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7backups.html)

**[Security](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7security.html)** in Open Dental: Define who has permission and access to specific features.

* Open Dental Users, [User Groups](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7securityusergroups.html), and [Permissions](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7permissions.html).
