API PatFieldDefs

See [API Specification](apispecification.html)

[Patient Field Defs](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7custompatientfields.html) allow you to organize fields that are found in various areas of Open Dental such as the Patient Information area of the Family Module, Account Module, and Chart Module.

In version 24.1, the PickList field was deprecated and replaced with the PatFieldPickItem table. Documentation has changed to reflect this, but the logic continues to support existing implementations.

Anyone using the API should also become very familiar with our schema documentation which contains important details about individual database table columns.
 See [PatFieldDef Database Schema.](SchemaRedirect%EF%B9%96patfielddef.html)
