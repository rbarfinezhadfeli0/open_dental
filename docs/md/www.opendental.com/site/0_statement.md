Different statement types can be quickly generated from a patient's account. This can be for a specific patient or the entire family.

You can choose from preset options or choose to customize a statement before generating. Preset options include:

* **Statement**: Generate a statement using the default [Billing](0_billing.html) options.
* **Walkout**: Generate a statement that includes procedures, payments, etc. for the current day only. Useful to give patients after an appointment.
* **Email**: Generate a PDF statement attached to an email. Statements can be sent securely when using the [Secure Email](secureemail.html) eService.
* **Invoice**: Generate a statement with a unique invoice number for selected production (e.g., procedures, adjustments, etc.) or the current day's procedures. Helpful to show total charges billed without payment information.
* **Limited**: Generate a statement for specific transactions or procedures.
