# Message-to-Pay: What Patient Sees

Message-to-Pay is designed for patients to quickly make a payment from their mobile device.

Message-to-Pay can be used with the following integrated payment processors:

* EdgeExpress (OpenEdge)
* PayConnect by DentalXChange
* PaySimple

## Initial Message

In the [Account Module](0_account.html), click the Payment dropdown, **Message-to-Pay**. Alternatively, when batch billing, you can include a Message-to-Pay link via text or email for all patients.

The patient will receive a text message or email with their balance information, a link to their statement, and a link to make a payment.

The patient can click the payment link to open the [Payment Portal](0_paymentportalsees.html) or click the statement link to open [Patient Portal](0_portalpatientsees.html).

## Payment Portal

Immediately upon opening the payment link, the patient can view their balance.

The patient can either make a one-time payment, or they can verify their identity to use an existing payment method or add a new one.

## Pay Now

When **Pay Now** is selected, the patient can choose to pay the full balance or make a partial payment.

## Verify and Pay

When **Verify and Pay** is selected, the patient chooses how to receive verification. Once the patient enters the verification code, they can make a payment using a previously saved payment method or by adding a new payment method.
