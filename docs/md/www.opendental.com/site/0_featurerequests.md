Feature Requests

The Feature Request system is a unique tool that allows offices to vote on features they want in Open Dental.

In the [Main Menu](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7mainmenu.html), click Help, **Request Features**.

Every office can vote on requests and submit new requests. This system is the official process for notifying Open Dental HQ of desired features and enhancements. Open Dental does not guarantee a request will become implemented, nor does Open Dental offer a timeline on implementation.

Your office can easily vote on existing features requests for changes you'd like to see or create your own features requests that other offices can vote on.
