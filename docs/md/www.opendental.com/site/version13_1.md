# Version 13.1

See [Versions](versions.html)

Version 13.1 was released on 6/25/2013.

**Procedure Locking:** Will not be used by most offices. Includes ability to append notes to a locked procedure. A locked procedure cannot be edited or deleted, but it can be invalidated. All completed procedures in a date range may be locked at one time with a tool. [Procedure Locking](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7procedurelocking.html)

**Wiki:** A full-blown wiki is now built into Open Dental. This can be a place for any staff to put any shared content, including employee manual, processes, etc. We use this feature heavily at Open Dental HQ, so it will be constantly enhanced. [Wiki](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7wiki.html) (documentation incomplete)

**Email:**  Email setup now handles multiple email addresses. A default email address can be set for each clinic.

**Spell Check:** Some important text boxes in Open Dental are now spell checked. Incorrect words are underlined with the option to replace with a suggested word or add to the custom dictionary. [Spell Check](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7spellcheck.html)

**Electronic Prescriptions:** There is no longer a need to manually double-enter [Electronic Rx](electronicrx.html).

**Minor Changes**
 HL7 interfaces now have additional settings for showing specific modules.
 Primary providers for patients can now be reassigned by most used provider using a tool in the providers window. [Providers](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7providers.html)
 On the Procedure Code window, the Description column now wraps so the entire description is visible. [Procedure Codes](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7procedurecodes.html)
 Sheets now print exactly the same as the on-screen display instead of with slightly different spacing. [Sheets](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7sheets.html)
 In the Images module, the 100 button sets the image zoom to 100%. [Images](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7images.html)
