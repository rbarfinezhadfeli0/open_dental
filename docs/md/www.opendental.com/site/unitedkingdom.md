United Kingdom

See [International Customers](countries.html).

Open Dental is currently used in the United Kingdom and it works well. Most practices that use Open Dental do not see a lot of NHS patients.

## Support

We generally provide email support to the United Kingdom because of the time difference. However, customers are always welcome to call us. We recommend you call us late in the day to catch us during our normal business hours (13:00 - 01:00 BST). We have a UK phone number listed on our website. See [Contact Us](contact.html).

## NHS Procedure Codes

A database containing the NHS procedure codes can be downloaded here: [uk.zip](../resources/uk.zip). The FP17 is not included and we cannot do electronic billing to NHS.
