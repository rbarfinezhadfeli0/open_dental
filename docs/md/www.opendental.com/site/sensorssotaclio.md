Sota Clio Sensors

See [Sensor Compatibility](sensorcompatibility.html)

While we have not tested it, Sota Imaging does have a Twain driver, so it should be compatible with Open Dental. Their Twain driver is called Clio Connect. At the bottom of this page:

<https://www.sotaimaging.com/drivers-and-downloads/>

is the link to Clio Connect:

After installing Clio Connect, look in their documentation for how to verify that the sensor is connected and functional.

Add the sensor in Open Dental in [Imaging Devices](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7imagingdevices.html). Make sure to check the box for "Show Twain UI". If you attempted to take radiographs without this box checked, then you may need to check the box and restart Open Dental.

In the [Imaging Module](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7images.html), in the top Toolbar, create a new [Mount](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7mountdefinitions.html). Click Acquire.
