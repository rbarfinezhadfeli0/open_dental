Tasks can be attached to patients or appointments for quick reference. Users can add additional notes to the task as needed. Tasks can be set up as a reminder to show at a specific date and time or an a recurring basis (e.g., monthly).

Relevant attachments (e.g., images, documents, etc.) can be attached to a task for easy reference.

Task Lists are used to organize tasks. Users can subscribe to specific Task Lists, allowing them to quickly view relevant tasks. Users can also access all task lists as needed. A Task List can be assigned to a specific user as an inbox so other users can easily reply to tasks or send them back to the originating user.
