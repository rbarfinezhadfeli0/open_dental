dot Net ( .NET )

Open Dental [Installation](installation.html) requires Microsoft .NET. If Windows is updated regularly, workstations should already have the required files installed. Newer versions of Windows come with .NET installed.

## Version 24.1 and Greater

In Open Dental Version 24.1 and greater, Microsoft .NET version 4.8 is required:

* [.NET 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net48) (link to Microsoft website)

## Version 20.2 and Greater

In Open Dental Version 20.2 and greater, two versions of Microsoft .NET are required. The minimum version requirements are as follows:

* [.NET 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472) (link to Microsoft website).
  + .NET 4.7.2 replaces .NET 4.5. This means they use the same runtime version, but the assembly versions are updated and include new types and members.
* [.NET 3.5](../resources/dotnetfx35bootstrapper.exe) (.exe)
  + .NET 3.5 is typically already included in Windows, but it may need to be turned on manually in the Control Panel.

## .NET Framework Repair Tool

Repair Tool: Sometimes the installation must be repaired. See <http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30135> to download the Microsoft .NET Framework Repair Tool.
