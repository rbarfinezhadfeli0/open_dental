"Open Dental is so easy to use...Each part of a patient's chart is clearly separated into easy-to-identify sections for each part of a dental office...

The software designers are forward-thinking, and because they are open to customers' ideas and suggestions, they are always bringing in new and exciting features."

"Tooth chart is efficient and informative...It is easy to add frequently used buttons. Easy to make auto notes and use the auto notes...It is easy to see insurance coverage and how much a patient owes so you know if they even need to stop at the front desk to check out. The schedule is easy to use and has color blocks that are not only efficient but just appealing. Perio charting is simple and so easy to toggle back and forth to show patient a change between this perio charting we took today vs another day they came in."
