API ProcTPs

See [API Specification](apispecification.html)

ProcTPs are copies of procedures that are attached to Saved treatment plans. The ProcNumOrig points to the actual procedurelog row. For Active and Inactive treatment plans, use [TreatPlanAttaches](apitreatplanattaches.html). See [Treatment Plans](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7treatmentplanedit.html) for more information.

Anyone using the API should also become very familiar with our schema documentation which contains important details about individual database table columns.
 See [ProcTP Database Schema.](SchemaRedirect%EF%B9%96proctp.html)
