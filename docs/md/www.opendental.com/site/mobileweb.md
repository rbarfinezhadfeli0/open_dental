# Mobile Web Feature

Open Dental's Mobile Web was an [eService](eservices.html) that allowed you to connect to Open Dental using an internet browser and your mobile device. [ODMobile](mobileapp.html), an app that can be installed right to your phone has replaced Open Dental Mobile Web and can be utilized by new and existing users! Existing users, on Open Dental Version 22.4 or greater, can continue to use Open Dental Mobile Web, however new features will not be added.
