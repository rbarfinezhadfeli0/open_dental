Planned Appointments are a feature that allow staff to create appointments before they're ready to be scheduled. The Planned Appointment Tracker can be used to manage these appointment to make sure they get scheduled.

The list can be filtered by provider and code range to easily find the patients or types of treatment you want to schedule in addition to other filters. The list can be easily printed as needed. Once scheduled, planned appointments are no longer listed in the tracker
