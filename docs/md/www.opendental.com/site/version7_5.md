# Version 7.5

See [Versions](versions.html)

Version 7.5 was released on 12/28/2010

During the upgrade process, you will be presented with a choice. It's good to read and understand this ahead of time, before the upgrade. Anyone who upgraded to 7.5 prior to 7.5.17 will not have seen this option. Their conversion will have combined plans.

**Insurance Subscribers:** Multiple subscribers can be attached to a single insurance plan. This will be the foundation for other exciting features. Currently, this change improves speed in offices that had thousands of subscribers with identical plans. [InsPlan](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7insplan.html).
