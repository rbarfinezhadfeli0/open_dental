Program Bridges

Within Open Dental you can link to external programs that you use within your practice. We call these links "bridges", and all you need to do is set up a Program Link. Below is a list of program bridges included with Open Dental, with links to detailed setup information.

For more third-party options, see [Vendors - Supplemental Services and Products](vendorssupplementalservices.html).

We recommend having a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) in place with a third-party program before enabling the associated program link. Many third-party programs gather and retain Protected Health Information (PHI), so a BAA will assist with [HIPAA](hipaa.html) compliance.

**Bridge Requests**
We pursue all requests for basic imaging bridges. There may be a handful of imaging software companies that have not responded to our contact attempts for bridging details. These requests are put on hold until we hear from the imaging software company. If you want to use a software that we do not bridge to, please let us know.
