ASAP List

The ASAP List shows patients who would like to be contacted when an earlier appointment becomes available.

In [Appointment Lists](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7appointmentlists.html), click **ASAP**.

The ASAP List can remain open while other areas of Open Dental are open. Use the list to identify patients and quickly notify them about available openings. Appointments can also be scheduled from here.

Easily open the [Edit Appointment](0_apptedit.html) window to view additional details by double-clicking an appointment in the list.

Use right-click options to quickly select a patient or jump to their chart, send the appointment to the Pinboard to be scheduled (see [Appointment Pinboard and Search](0_apptsearch.html)), or remove a patient from the list.

The list can be filtered by provider or code range, making it simple to find the right patients to fill an opening.

The [Integrated Texting Feature](textintegrated.html) can be used to send text messages to a patient right from the list. Use the WebSched ASAP feature (see [Web Sched Feature](websched.html)) to message patients and allow them to claim an opening online.

## Appointments Tab

This is the default tab for the ASAP list and includes any appointments marked ASAP. Easily filter the list by appointment status and if the appointment is hygiene or not.
