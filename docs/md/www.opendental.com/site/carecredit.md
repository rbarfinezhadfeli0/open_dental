# CareCredit

CareCredit is now integrated with Open Dental.

CareCredit's integration into Open Dental helps your practice save time, increase productivity, and makes it easier for patients to apply for the CareCredit credit card and process transactions. Plus, you can easily identify which patients are pre-approved or already have an existing CareCredit credit card, even before they visit your office. This helps give patients a financing option so they can move forward with recommended treatment.

**Increased financial visibility.**

Increased financial visibility. Cost can be one of the biggest barriers to care for patients. The CareCredit Quickscreen ![](images/rightsReserved.png) feature provides invaluable financial visibility that empowers your staff to confidently offer financing options. Eliminate uncertainty by pre-approving patients and checking available credit for existing CareCredit cardholders before their visit. Use these insights to help patients overcome cost barriers and increase treatment acceptance.

**Easier to apply.**

Patient information is automatically transferred from Open Dental to the CareCredit application. When your patient wants to apply for a CareCredit credit card, simply type in a few fields and click submit and receive a credit decision within seconds.

**Easier to transact.**

Now CareCredit credit card transactions can be processed directly from the Payment window and it will automatically post back to the patient's Account Module.

## Getting Started

First, ensure your office is signed up with CareCredit. Once signed up, go to CareCredit Setup in Open Dental to enable the feature. If you're using Quickscreen ![](images/rightsReserved.png), make sure to enable this in CareCredit setup as well. If you want to see Quickscreen ![](images/rightsReserved.png) information for a patient, add the applicable CareCredit fields to Patient Field Defs.

If you are not currently using CareCredit and are interested in increasing treatment acceptance by becoming part of the CareCredit network, call (800) 859-9975, or visit <https://www.carecredit.com/providers/> to enroll today.
