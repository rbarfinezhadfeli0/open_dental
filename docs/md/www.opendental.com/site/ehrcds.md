# EHR Objective 2: Clinical Decision Support ( CDS )

This information applies to EHR Modified Stage 2 for Program Years 2015 to 2018. For current information, see:

* [EHR Modified Stage 2](ehrmodified2.html)
* [2019 Program Requirements - Medicaid](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/EHRIncentivePrograms/2019ProgramRequirementsMedicaid.html)
* [Open Dental EHR](https://opendental.com/site/ehrlicense.html)

Measures: CDS rules trigger CDS interventions that provide evidence-based clinical guidance when a user is making a clinical decision. Providers must satisfy both measures to satisfy this objective.

1. Measure 1: Implement five clinical decision support interventions related to four or more CQMs or high-priority health conditions at a relevant point of patient care for the entire reporting period.
2. Measure 2: Enable and implement drug-drug and drug-allergy interaction checks for the entire EHR reporting period.

**Exclusion Available?**

Yes. If a provider writes less than 100 medication orders during the reporting period, an exclusion is available for measure 2 (drug interaction checks).

Note: EHR providers in New York do not qualify for this exclusion because the state requires e-prescribing. Use eRx comprehensive so that drug interaction checks and formulary checks are enabled.
