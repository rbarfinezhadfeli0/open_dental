# EHR Attestation

To receive an [EHR/PI](ehrlicense.html) incentive payment each year, you need to go through attestation with your state Medicaid office or CMS (Medicare). See [Registration and Attestation](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/EHRIncentivePrograms/RegistrationandAttestation.html) on the cms.gov website.

How to avoid mistakes that could cost you money:

1. Count on being audited. Retain supporting documentation for at least 6 years. The audit rate for EHR is high. See [EHR Audits](ehraudits.html).
2. Enter into an EHR contract with Open Dental. Do not apply retroactively for an EHR incentive participation year if you did not have an EHR contract for that year.
3. Certification for EHR is a vendor/product combination, not just a product. CMS dictates that any contract for an EHR purchase must be directly with the vendor. Thus, EHR-certified versions of Open Dental can only be purchased directly from Open Dental. You cannot purchase an EHR-certified version of Open Dental from a reseller.
4. For AIU, make sure your AIU participation year matches the EHR contract year.

   Note: 2016 was the last year to start participation in the EHR Medicaid Incentive Program (AIU).
5. If you have accepted an incentive payment, do not cancel your Open Dental support or contract early.
6. Make sure you meet EHR incentive program requirements before accepting payment.
7. Don't make up numbers when reporting meaningful use. If you are using Open Dental EHR as designed, your reporting will provide the accurate figures.
8. You must comply with HIPAA requirements and have a Security Risk Analysis (SRA) in place. Do not claim you had an SRA if you did not.

Providers who make a mistake during attestation for AIU can self report and have their year changed.

## Information required during attestation

   * Numerators, denominators, and percentages for EHR Modified Stage 2 measures. See [EHR Measure Reports](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7ehrmeasures.html).
   * Evidence that supports or explains any exclusions claimed.
   * Additional supporting documentation such as date-stamped screenshots, reports, or acknowledgments that support yes/no and other objectives.
   * Clinical Quality Measure numerators, denominators, and percentages: See [Report EHR Clinical Quality Measures (CQMs)](../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl%3D%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7ehrcqmreport.html).

Hints:

* Retain all supporting documentation for at least 6 years in case of audit.
* We recommend you create an EHR folder and store all supporting documentation in one place for easy access. See also: [CMS Supporting Documents for Audits](http://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/EHRIncentivePrograms/Downloads/EHR_SupportingDocumentation_Audits.pdf).
* If supporting documentation includes query results, you may want to include identifying header information on the end report. To add a title, save the query to your Query Favorites, then enter a Title that includes all identifying information (e.g. title, date ranges, provider). Then run the query again.
