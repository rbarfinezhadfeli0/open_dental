# Version 3.7

See [Versions](versions.html)

Released on 9/26/05

**Clinics:** The clinic field has now been added to procedures, appointments, operatories, and claims. And you can enter a separate address for each clinic.

**Payment Plan Amortization:** Total control over amount and date of each payment in the amortization schedule instead of the payment being the same every month.

**Operatories**: Operatory table added to database instead of using the definition table. This allows attaching dentists, hygienists, and clinics to operatories. Now, you can see the provider schedule as the background color in an operatory. Also, when you drag an appointment to a new operatory, it automatically changes the provider for you.

**Patient balance:** Option to track patient balances with or without insurance estimate taken into consideration.

**Print Patient Progress Notes**

**Fee Schedule Tools:** Clear a fee schedule, increase a fee schedule by a percentage, copy a fee schedule.
