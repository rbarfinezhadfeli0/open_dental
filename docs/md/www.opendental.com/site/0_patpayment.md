## Current Payment Splits

Payment Splits (paysplits) determine how a payment is allocated amongst procedures or other production.

Paysplits affect reports, including which providers payment is attributed to. By default, paysplits are automatically created and allocated to selected procedures or using First In, First Out logic. Paysplit allocation settings, can be customized and individual paysplits can be edited as needed. A single payment can be split to multiple patients.

## Outstanding Charges and Treatment Planned Procedures

See what charges are currently outstanding and view treatment planned procedures. These charges can be used to generate new paysplits.

**Outstanding Tab**: Lists all adjustments, pay plan charges, and completed procedures.

**Treat Plan Tab**: View treatment planned procedures to attach to the payment. This prevents accounts from showing a credit when taking prepayments.
