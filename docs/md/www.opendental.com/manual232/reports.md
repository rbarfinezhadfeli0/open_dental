* **eService Activity Log**: Opens the [eService Activity Log](eserviceactivitylog.html).
* **Unfinalized Payments**: Shows the number of outstanding unfinalized payments in parentheses e.g., (3).

For the number of unfinalized payments to show, the [Open Dental Service](opendentalservice.html) must be installed and running.

Other Reports in Open Dental:

* To add a click-able URL as a Reports menu option, see [Custom Bridges](bridgecustom.html).
* [Appointment Lists](appointmentlists.html)
* Accounting reports (General Ledger Detail and Balance Sheets). See [Accounting Close Year](accountingcloseyear.html).
* Clearinghouse reports. See [Send Claims](claimsend.html).
* [Arizona Reports](../resources/Arizona.txt)
* Custom Reports: Some users may have a Custom Reports menu item. It means there is a reports folder in the A to Z Folders (typically Reports) that contains at least one .rdl file (e.g., Unsched Treat Plans.rdl). For each .rdl file in the folder, there will be one menu item.

Note: If an office converted from another software, users should not run reports with dates prior to or on the conversion day.
