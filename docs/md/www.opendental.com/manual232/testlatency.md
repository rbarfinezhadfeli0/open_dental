* **Latency**: Measures turnaround time (how long it takes your computer to travel to the database and back). It is measured in milliseconds. The lower the latency, the less delay. Measurements vary from network to network, but on average a good result is less than 50 ms.
* **Speed**: Measures how long it will take to generate a complex query. It is measured in megabits per second.

Click **Test** to calculate.
