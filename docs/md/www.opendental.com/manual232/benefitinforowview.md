Edit Benefits - Row View

Use the Benefits Row view to view each benefit as a line item.

In the [Edit Benefits](benefitinfo.html) window, uncheck the Simplified View box.

This is useful when typical [Insurance Categories](inscatssetup.html) are not used (e.g., in a country other than the U.S. or Canada).

* **Simplified View**: Check/uncheck the box to switch between [Simplified View](benefitinfo.html) and Row View.
* **Benefit Year**: See Simplified View for details. This area does not change when using Simplified or Row View.
* **Benefits**: Each row represents a benefit. Double-click to edit. See [Edit Benefit](editbenefit.html).
* **Add**: Create a new insurance benefit. Opens the Edit Benefit window.
* **Delete**: Select an item in the grid and click to remove an existing insurance benefit.
* **Notes**: The same as subscriber notes on the [Insurance Plan](insplan.html). Certain types of benefits are not easily codified, so they do not have a box. These types of benefits are just entered as subscriber notes for now. Examples of benefits which get entered as notes are:
  + Missing tooth exclusion (a clause that states that if a tooth was extracted before the patient became insured through them, that they will not cover any replacement teeth including a partial or a bridge).
  + Wait on major treatment (usually 6 months to a year).
