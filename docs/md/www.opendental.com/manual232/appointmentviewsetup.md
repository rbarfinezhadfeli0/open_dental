[Appointment Views](appointmentviews.html) determine the Operatories and providers that show in the [Appointments Module](appointments.html) and the information that shows in a view's appointment box.

* **Clinics**: If using [Clinics](clinics.html), views are associated with specific Clinics. Users can only access appointment views for clinics they have access to.
* **Views**: Lists the appointment views already setup. Each view is associated with a function key (e.g., F1). The Fkey is determined by the view's order in the list. Double-click a view to open [Appointment View Edit](appointmentvieweditwindow.html).
* **Add**: Click to create a new Appointment View. Opens Appointment View Edit.
* **Up**/**Down** Arrows: Select a view, then use the arrows to rearrange Appointment Views in the list.
* **Time Increments**: Set the time increment (5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes). The time increment affects all views. Updating the appointment time increment also affects Time Patterns on [Procedures](procedurecodeedit.html), [Recall Types](recalltypes.html), and [Appointment Types](appointmenttypes.html). When changing Time Increments, also review Time Patterns to match.
* **Proc Colors**: Click to edit [Proc Appt Colors](apptviewproccolors.html).
