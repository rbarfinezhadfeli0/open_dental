## Attachment Process

1. Send the claim or predetermination as normal, without any attachments.
2. The response will return as an Acknowledgment. Attachments can not be added if the response returns an EOB or Rejection.
3. Navigate to the Canadian Attachments tab.
4. Add images or files as needed.
5. Click **Send Attachments**.

Attachments can be sent immediately after receiving the Acknowledgment response, or much later if the attachments were requested by mail.

Up to 30 attachments can be sent at one time.

## Setup

To utilize attachments:

* An image category must be marked as *Claim Attachments* in [Definitions: Image Categories](definitionsimagecat.html).
* The carrier must have a Supported Transaction Type of *Attachment*.
