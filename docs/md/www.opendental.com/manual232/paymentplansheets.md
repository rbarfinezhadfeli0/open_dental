Payment Plan Layout

Payment plan printouts can be customized to meet the needs of the practice.

In [Sheets](sheets.html), double-click on a custom sheet with the type of PaymentPlan.

Alternatively, in Sheets:

* Click **New** and choose *PaymentPlan* as the Sheet Type to create a new payment plan sheet from blank.
* Select an existing Custom *PaymentPlan* sheet and click **Duplicate** to create a copy of an existing payment plan sheet.
* Select the existing Internal *PaymentPlan* sheet and click **Copy** to create a copy of the default payment plan sheet that can be edited.

Also see: [Sheet Def Properties](sheetproperties.html) and [Sheet Field Types](sheetsaddelements.html).

## Preferences

Enable  *Pay Plans use Sheets for printing* in [Preferences](preferences.html) to use a sheet layout when [Printing a Payment Plan](paymentplanprint.html) from the Account Module.

If no custom sheet has been created, the internal sheet is used. If multiple custom *PaymentPlan* sheets exist, the top-most (i.e., first alphabetically) sheet is used when printing.

## Customizing a Payment Plan Sheet

To customize a PaymentPlan sheet type, see [Edit Sheet Def](sheetsetup.html).

The layout of printed [Payment Plan](paymentplanpatient.html) terms ([Sign and Print Payment Plan](paymentplanprint.html)) can be customized by setting up a sheet with a PaymentPlan type. If enabled, the same custom sheet is used for all printed payment plans.

Additional information:

* There is one grid, *PayPlanGrid*, that is only available for sheets with a PaymentPlan type. The columns in the grid are fixed and cannot be changed. See [Sheet Grid](sheetsgrid.html).
* One [Sheet Signature Box](sheetssignature.html) can be added to a payment plan sheet for [Electronic Signatures](electronicsignatures.html). If added, a preview window displays before printing so the plan can be signed.
* Printed and signed payment plans can be saved as PDFs in the Imaging Module by designating an Image Category usage as *(A) Payment Plans* in [Definitions: Image Categories](definitionsimagecat.html).
