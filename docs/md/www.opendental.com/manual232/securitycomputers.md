Computer Security

See [Computer and Network Setup](computernetworksetup.html).

Security for computer systems is a multi-faceted issue that is essential for [HIPAA](../site/hipaa.html) compliance and data protection. Addressing these issues correctly from the start will prevent issues later on.

When considering how computer systems are configured, practices will need to address security in three areas:

**Network Security**: For the security of the network, practices will need to address:

* [Firewall](firewalls.html)
* [MySQL Security](securitymysql.html)
* [Share A to Z Folder](atozshare.html)

**Computer Security**: For the security of computers, practices will need to address:

* [Windows Update](windowsupdates.html)
* [Network Users](networkusers.html) (user names/passwords for Windows)
* [Antivirus](virus.html)
* [Encryption of Data at Rest and in Transit](encryption.html)
* [Backups](backups.html)

**[Security](security.html)** in Open Dental: Define who has permission and access to specific features.

* Open Dental Users, [User Groups](securityusergroups.html), and [Permissions](permissions.html).
* User credentials for third-party programs (e.g., imaging software).
