Close Payment Plan

The Close Payment Plans tool allows offices to easily close out all Payment Plans with a zero balance and no future charges.

In the [Main Menu](mainmenu.html), click Tools, Misc Tools, Close Payment Plans.

This tool is helpful if the practice has Payment Plans showing in the [Payment Plan Report](reportpaymentplan.html) that have zero balance or a negative balance, no future charges, but are not closed.

Once the tool is clicked, the above message appears.

**Include Dynamic Payment Plans**: Check to close [Dynamic Payment Plans](paymentplandynamic.html) with zero balance or a negative balance, no future charges, and no treatment planned procedures when running the tool. Uncheck to exclude Dynamic Payment Plans when running the tool.

Click **OK** to continue and close all plans that meet the criteria. Click **Cancel** to close the tool without closing Payment Plans.

A confirmation appears once Payment Plans have finished closing, indicating the number of Payments Plans closed. If no Payments Plans met the criteria, a message appears instead indicating "*There were no plans to close.*"
