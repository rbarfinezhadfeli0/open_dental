EHR Report Clinical Quality Measures (CQMs)

We recommend checking [EHR Clinical Quality Measures](ehrcqm.html) (CQMs) percentages early during your reporting period to make sure values are increasing.

* If denominators are 0, there are no [EHR Encounters](ehrencounters.html). Set a default encounter code or manually create encounters.
* If the numerator values are low, make sure you are completing the actions required. See [EHR Clinical Quality Measure Descriptions](ehrcqmdef.html).

1. On the [EHR Dashboard](ehrdashboard1.html), click *Quality Meas*.

2. Enter the reporting period start and end dates and select the provider to report on.
3. Click **Refresh** to update the list.

A CQM may be represented by several rows if the data is divided into different classifications (e.g. divided by age groups). Double click a row to see exactly what is included in each denominator, numerator, exception, etc. See [EHR CQM Calculation Details](ehrcqmdetails.html).

To export and submit the CQM data:

1. Click **Create QRDAs**.
2. Select a location on your computer to export the CQM files to, then click OK. A message will show indicating the files have been exported successfully. The file set will be grouped under a dated CQM folder in the file location.
3. Submit the report.
