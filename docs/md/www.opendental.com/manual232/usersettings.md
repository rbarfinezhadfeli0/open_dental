**Close/Log off message is suppressed**: Check to disable log off warning message. See [Log On](securitylogin.html).

**Chart graphics color distinguishes current provider**: When checked, completed procedures done by a provider other than the one that is currently logged on are colored as *Existing Other* in the tooth chart.

* If the logged-on user is not associated with a provider, the provider on today's appointment is considered the logged-on provider.
* If the logged-on user is not associated with a provider, and there is no appointment today, the patient's default primary provider is considered the logged-on provider.
* When changing this setting, users must close out of Open Dental and re-open to see changes take effect.

**Automatic logoff time in minutes**: Displays the user specific logoff time as set in [User Edit](securityusers.html). No value entered means it uses the default set in [Global Security Settings](securitysettings.html). 0 means disabled. Users with the proper permissions can change their value in User Edit.
