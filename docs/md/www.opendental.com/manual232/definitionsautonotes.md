In the [Main Menu](mainmenu.html), click Setup, [Definitions](definitions.html), Auto Note Categories.

![](images/definitionsAutoNotes.png)

The Auto Note Categories definition determines which category folders are available to organize [Auto Notes](autonotes.html). This list is empty by default. Add categories as needed.

Categories can be nested within each other. If a category is nested in another category, its parent will list under the Parent Category.

To change the order of the categories as viewed in the auto note window, see [Auto Note Setup](autonotesetup.html). Changing the order in the Definitions window does not change the view in the Auto Notes window.

Double-click an existing item or click **Add** to create a new item. The Edit Definition window will open.
