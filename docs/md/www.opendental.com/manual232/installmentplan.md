Installment Plan

Installment Plans are a quick and easy alternative to [Payment Plan](paymentplanpatient.html).

In the [Account Module](account.html), Installment Plans are listed in the Payment Plans grid for the family guarantor.

Note: This grid can also include [Payment Plans](paymentplanpatient.html), [Dynamic Payment Plans](paymentplandynamic.html), and [Insurance Payment Plans](paymentplanins.html).

Alternatively, double-click an existing Installment Plan from the grid to view details or edit.

In the Account Module toolbar, click **Installment Plan** to create a new installment plan.

Installment plans allow offices to bill patients an agreed monthly amount. Default statements show the fixed monthly amount due. Additional charges posted after the Installment Plan creation date do not affect the monthly due balance, nor do missed payments.

**Date of Agreement / Date of First Payment**: Auto-filled with today's date.

**Monthly Payment**: The monthly payment amount.

**APR**: The annual percentage rate (APR). When using the Finance Charge tool for an account that has an Installment Plan set up for any family member, this APR is used instead of the APR set in [Billing/Finance Charges](financecharges.html).

**Notes**: Additional information about the Installment Plan.

Click **OK** to save.

## Troubleshooting

**The Installment Plan shows *Invalid Guarantor* in the Payment Plans grid. What do I do?**

The family guarantor has changed since the Installment Plan was originally created (i.e., a patient was moved to a new family or another family member was made guarantor). Delete the Installment Plan and recreate it. The current family guarantor is made the patient on the Installment Plan.
