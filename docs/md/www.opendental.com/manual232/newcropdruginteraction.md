NewCrop eRx Drug-Drug, Drug-Allergy Interaction Checks

In the [NewCrop eRx / Prescription](newcrop.html) interface, comprehensive version, drug-drug and drug-allergy interaction checks are automated.

Offices must contact Open Dental Support to turn on this feature.

* Drug-Drug: Prescriptions are checked against current and pending medications listed on the Compose Rx page.
* Drug-Allergy: Prescriptions are compared to patient allergies listed on the Compose Rx page.

If the NewCrop eRx preference *Only Show Severe/Contraindicated Warnings* is checked, warnings for mild and moderate interactions will be suppressed. To enable or disable this preference:

1. Click on the NewCrop eRx **Admin** tab.
2. Click **Account/Prescriber Settings** in the *Account Configuration* area.
3. Check or uncheck *Only Show Severe/Contraindicated Warnings*.
   * Checked: Only severe/contraindicated interaction alerts will appear.
   * Unchecked: All interaction alerts will appear.
   * The box can only be checked or unchecked if the prescriber is logged on.

At this time, the patient's allergy and medication list in Open Dental is not passed to NewCrop eRx. If an allergy or medication is not listed, see [NewCrop eRx Allergies](newcropallergies.html) or [NewCrop eRx Medications](newcropmedications.html).
