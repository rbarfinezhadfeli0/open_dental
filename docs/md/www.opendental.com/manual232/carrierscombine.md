Combine Carriers

Combining insurance carriers in the Carriers List blends multiple insurance carriers into one.

In the [Carriers](carriers.html) window, on the right side, is a **Combine** button.

Combining carriers is useful when multiple versions of the same carrier have been inadvertently created. This can happen when carrier information was updated on the Edit Insurance Plan window instead of from the main list.

Caution: Combining carriers is irreversible. When carriers are combines, only one carrier's information is retained. Any insurance plans with the other carriers are automatically assigned the new carrier.

To combine carriers:

1. Highlight the carriers to combine.
2. Click **Combine**.
