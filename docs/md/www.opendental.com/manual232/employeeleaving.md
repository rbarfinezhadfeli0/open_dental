Employee Leaving

If an employee leaves your practice, below are some steps to follow.

Note: If using the [Time Clock](timeclock.html), do not hide or delete any employees until payroll has been processed.

* [Task List and Inbox](tasklists.html): Employee task lists can be renamed or reassigned to a new user. To remove it as a *To Task List* option:
  1. Right-click on the employee's task list.
  2. Click **Edit Properties**.
  3. Set the Object Type as *None*.
* [Schedule Setup](schedule.html): Remove the employee from the daily schedule. Use the Copy Day/Copy Week feature to change future days as needed.
* [Employees](employees.html): Mark the employee as hidden.
* [Security](security.html): Mark the user as hidden. Users cannot be hidden if they have the *Security Admin* permission. Change the user's user group before hiding if necessary.

## Provider Leaving

If a [Provider](providerseditwindow.html) (doctor or hygienist) is leaving, there are additional steps to follow.

* [Operatories](operatories.html): If the provider is assigned to an operatory, change the provider, or select *None*.
* [Appointment Views](appointmentviews.html): Remove the provider bar from any appointment views.
* [Move Patients](../manual/providers.html): Move the provider's patients to a different provider.
* [Provider Edit](providerseditwindow.html): Mark the provider as *Hidden*. This removes the provider as a selection option for appointments and procedures, and it removes any future schedule for the provider. Appointments are not affected.
  + To remove the provider as selectable on reports, also check *Hidden on Reports*.
* Manually remove the provider from future appointments (a different provider must be selected) or use the [Update Provs on Future Appts](updateprovsfutureappts.html) to reassign all appointments for a specific operatory to the scheduled provider.
