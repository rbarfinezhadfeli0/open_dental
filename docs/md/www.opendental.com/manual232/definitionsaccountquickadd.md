Definitions: Account Procs Quick Add

In the [Main Menu](mainmenu.html), click Setup, [Definitions](definitions.html), Account Procs Quick Add.

The Account Procs Quick Add definition determines the list of items available in the [Quick Procs](quickprocs.html) dropdown in the Account Module. This list is empty by default. Add procedures as needed.

Double-click an existing item or click **Add** to create a new item. The Edit Definition window will open.

* **Name**: Enter the item name. This identifies the item in the Quick Procs dropdown. However, when the item is added to the patient's account, the procedure's description will be used.
* **Procedure Codes**: Enter the procedure code or group of codes associated with the item. To enter more than one code, separate each code with a comma and do not add spaces (e.g., D0140,D0220). This field is case sensitive so enter the code as it appears in the [Procedure Codes](procedurecodes.html) list.

Click OK to save.

To remove an item from Account Procs Quick Add:

* If the item has never been added to a patient's account, click **Delete**. The item will be removed entirely.
* If the item has been used in a patient's account, check **Hidden**. The item will no longer show in the dropdown but will continue to list as a definition.
