NewCrop eRx uses the medications entered here when doing [Drug Interaction Checks](newcropdruginteraction.html). When a user writes and transmits an electronic prescription, the medication will automatically list here. However, medications entered directly in Open Dental are not currently passed to NewCrop eRx; users must manually enter them.

1. Click the **Med Entry** tab at the top of the NewCrop Rx window.
2. If needed, enter in *Outside Prescriber* name and *Original Date* for the medication.
