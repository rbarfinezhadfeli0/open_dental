## Add a Patient Picture

The category marked as *Patient Pictures* usage in [Definitions: Image Categories](definitionsimagecat.html) should be used to store patient pictures. By default, this is the *Patient Pictures* category of the [Imaging Module](images.html). The most recent image in this category is used as the patient picture. Typical file types are jpg, gif, and png.

## Take a Picture

To take the patient's picture, use a webcam or digital camera, then save the image in an appropriate file format (jpg, gif, or png).

Webcams can be used in Open Dental to take a patient photo using [Video Capture](videocapture.html). An active registration key or trial version is required.

Alternatively, if a webcam has a TWAIN driver is installed, users can take a patient picture using the scan button. The scan button does not support a live feed so users will not be able to view the image before it is taken. If there are no other scanners, the webcam can be set as the default scanner, otherwise users should enable *Show Select Scanner Window* in [Imaging Quality](imagingsetup.html) to select the webcam when clicking the scan button.

Note: We are unable to give recommendations regarding specific models of webcam due to the vast number of models and differences in customer hardware. See [Imaging Camera Compatibility](imagingcameracompatibility.html) for additional information.
