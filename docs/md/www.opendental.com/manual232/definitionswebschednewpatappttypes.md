The Web Sched New Pat Appt Types definition determines the list of available *Reasons for Appointment* options patients select from when scheduling an appointment using the [Web Sched New Patient](webschednewpatsetup.html) feature.

Create [Appointment Types](appointmenttypes.html) first to determine the length and procedures for certain types of appointments. Then assign a Web Sched New Pat Appt Type to the appointment type. When a patient schedules an appointment online and selects one of these types from the list of appointment reasons, an appointment will be created with the procedures and for the length designated in the associated appointment type.

Double-click an existing item or click **Add** to create a new item. The Edit Definition window will open.
