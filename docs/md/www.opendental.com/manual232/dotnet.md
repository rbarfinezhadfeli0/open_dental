dot Net ( .NET )

Open Dental [Installation](installation.html) requires Microsoft .NET. If Windows is updated regularly, workstations should already have the required files installed. Newer versions of Windows come with .NET installed.

In Open Dental Version 20.2 and greater, two versions of Microsoft .NET are required. The minimum version requirements are as follows:

[.NET 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472) (link to Microsoft website).

* .NET 4.7.2 replaces .NET 4.5. This means they use the same runtime version, but the assembly versions are updated and include new types and members.

[.NET 3.5](../resources/dotnetfx35bootstrapper.exe) (.exe)

* .NET 3.5 is typically already included in Windows, it may need to be manually turned on in the Control Panel.

Repair Tool: Sometimes the installation must be repaired. See <http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30135> to download the Microsoft .NET Framework Repair Tool.
