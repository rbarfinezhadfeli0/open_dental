SMS Warning Amount

In [eServices Signup Basic](signupportalbasic.html), at the top, is the SMS Warning area.

![](images/textIntegratedWarningAmt.gif)

**SMS Warning Amount**: Enter a warning amount, per clinic. The Warning Amount is an estimate of how much each location (clinic) would like to spend on outgoing text messages per month. Once the amount is reached each month, users will be unable to manually send text messages until the amount is increased or a new billing cycle begins.

* If $20 is the amount and there are three clinics, each clinic has an amount of $20, but the total amount will equal $60.
* The SMS Warning Amount does not apply to or stop automated eReminders, eConfirmations, Web Sched Recall, or Web Sched ASAP text messages.
* If the practice is on support, click Save at the bottom to save changes. If the practice is not on support, the **Save SMS Limit** button will show instead.
