Drop Insurance Plan

If a patient is no longer covered by an insurance plan, the plan can be dropped.

Dropping an [Insurance Plan](insplan.html) removes the plan from the selected patient only. Historical information is not affected, and the plan still exists in the [Insurance Plans](insplanlist.html) list. The plan no longer shows in the patient's insurance area. It is still listed in  *Insurance Plans for Family* area. Click the [Add Insurance](insadd.html) dropdown, **Plans for Family** to see it.

If insurance estimates exist on *unsent* procedures at the time the insurance is dropped, the estimates are deleted.

## Re-Adding Dropped Insurance

To re-add a dropped plan:

1. In the [Family Module](family.html), click **Add Insurance**.
2. If the patient is the subscriber, click **Yes**. If the patient is not the subscriber, click **No**, then select the subscriber.
3. Double-click the dropped plan from the list to select it. The dropped plan is indicated with *(not in use)*.
