Schedule Graph

A graph of the Schedule is available to give users a visual representation of each provider and employee's work schedule for a single day.

Alternatively, in [Schedule Edit](scheduleeditdaywindow.html), click the Graph tab.

The graph is divided into 15 minute time segments. A vertical bar indicates the current time. Click the arrows in the upper left to move forward or back one day.

**Date**: The upper left corner shows the selected day. Click the arrows to move forward or back one day.

**Search**: This function only works from the List tab.

**Clinic**: Select the clinic's schedule to view.

**Sort**: Sort the chart by start time, stop time, or employee/provider name.

**Filter**: Select what should appear in the chart.

* Notes: Display any practice or clinic notes. These will appear first.
* Providers: Display all scheduled providers. These will appear second in the list, as a group.
* Employees: Display all scheduled employees. Employees are identified by name, and any notes entered in their time block show.

**Scale**: Select the start and end hour to display.

* 0 = 12:00 AM
* 24 = 12:00 PM

To add or enter time block, holiday, or notes, use the panel on the right. See [Schedule Edit](scheduleeditdaywindow.html).

If **Delete** is clicked from the Graph tab, the entire day's schedule will be deleted.
