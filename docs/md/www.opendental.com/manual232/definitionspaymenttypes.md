The Payment Types definition determines the list of patient payment type options available in the [Edit Payment](payment.html) window.

Also set which payment types to exclude when creating a [Deposit Slip](depositslip.html). The [Daily Payments Report](reportdailypayments.html) is grouped by patient payment type and can optionally be filtered by type.

Double-click an existing item or click **Add** to create a new item. The Edit Definition window will open.

* **Name**: Enter the payment type.
* **N=Not selected for deposit**: Enter N to exclude this type from deposit slips or leave blank to include this type.

Click OK to save.

Note: If a *Cash* payment type does not exist, one will be automatically created for use in [Deposit Slips](depositslip.html). If you have been using a different payment type to track cash payments, you must change them to the *Cash* payment type in order to track money payments in a deposit.
