## Updating Canada Fee Guides

When a new fee guide is released, we recommend making a copy of the original fee guide for reference, then importing the new fees into the original fee guide. By doing it this way, the fees are updated and fee guides do not need to be reassigned to providers.

**Update Open Dental**
 Some fee guides require an Open Dental [Update](updateinstall.html) prior to importing the latest fee guide. Find the fee guide in the list below to see the required Open Dental version.

**Create a backup of the original fee guide:**

1. Create a new fee guide named after the original (e.g., UCR2023\_copy). See [Fee Schedules](feeschedules.html).
2. Under Lists, [Procedure Codes](procedurecodes.html), click Fee Tools.
3. Under Select Fees, select the fee guide to copy (the original).
4. In Copy To, select the fee guide to copy the fees into (e.g., the new fee guide, UCR2023\_copy).
5. Click Copy. The new fee guide will now be a copy of the original fee guide.

**Import fees into the original fee guide:**

1. Clear the original fee guide:
   1. Click Fee Tools.
   2. Under Select Fees, select the original fee guide.
   3. Click Clear to remove the fees from the original fee guide.
2. Import the new fees into the original fee guide:
   1. Click Fee Tools.
   2. Under Select Fees, select the original fee guide.
   3. Click Import Canada.
      * Some guides require a Member ID and Password from the providing province.
      * If fees have not been cleared (the fees still exist in the original), a warning displays. Click OK to proceed, or Cancel to close without importing.
   4. The Fee Sched Pick Remote window displays all of the fee guides currently available for download. To import, double-click on a fee guide or select it then click OK. A message indicates when the import is finished.

Note:

* Custom codes created by the office may need fees re-entered after updating a fee guide.
* To update the fees on treatment plans for all patients, see Update Fees in [Fee Tools](feescheduletools.html).

## Available Guides by Province

Note:

* We do not include fee guides for the Denturist Association of Canada (DAC).
* When a procedure on a fee guide has a range, Open Dental defaults to the lower fee. Users must make edits on their own if they would like the higher fees.
* Please contact Open Dental Support if the fee guide needed is not listed as we may have an alternate method of import.
* Fee Guides that have an alternate method of import require Open Dental Support.
