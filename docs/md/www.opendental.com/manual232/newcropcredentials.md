NewCrop eRx Credentialing

Prior to sending a prescription via the [NewCrop eRx / Prescription](newcrop.html) interface, prescribers must complete credentialing.

Credentialing is part of the process of NewCrop eRX identity proofing. It entails submitting credentials to further confirm provider identity.

## Step 1 - Complete Identity Proofing

First complete identity proofing by contacting Open Dental support. Do not move on to Step 2 until identity proofing has been completed. This step is required for all prescribing providers.

## Step 2 - Send Email

When identity proofing is complete, send an email to providerverification@newcroprx.com that contains the following information.

**To:** providerverification@newcroprx.com

**Cc:** erx@opendental.com

**Subject:** (provider name) Credentialing

**Email address:** Email address the prescriber used during Exostar identity proofing.

**Mobile number:** Personal mobile number. This will be used once for verification purposes only.

**Mobile carrier:** Cell phone carrier

**Office address:**

**Office phone**:

**Contact person:** Any person, other than the provider, who can verify the practice is active (e.g., office manager).

**Software:** Open Dental

**NewCrop eRx Version:** Basic or Comprehensive

Also attach scanned copies of the following documents, or they can be faxed to 832-553-1889.

* State license paperwork
* DEA paperwork
* NPI paperwork. If the prescriber does not have a copy of their NPI paperwork, see <https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/>
* State ID (e.g., driver's license) in color or grayscale. Black and white is not permitted.

Once credentials have been submitted, it will take approximately 48 hours to finalize. The prescriber will receive a confirmation email from Open Dental. We will then activate electronic transmission of prescriptions on the prescriber's account and apply the one-time identity proofing fee to the office's statement.

To sign up for EPCS contact [Open Dental Support](https://opendental.com/contact.html) to speak with a member of our eRx team.
