**Billing Type 1/2:** Only visible when Medicaid is turned on in [Show Features](showfeatures.html). Billing types can be manually set per procedure in order to flag procedures for inclusion in custom reports.

**Prognosis:** Prognosis is not used by most offices, although it may be required in some states. If it is required to show on the treatment plan, then use [Display Fields](displayfields.html) to add a prognosis column to the [Treatment Plan Module](treatmentplan.html) main grid. To speed entry, prognosis can be set when entering treatment. Customize options in [Definitions: Prognosis](definitionsprognosis.html).

**Site:** Only visible if [Public Health](publichealth.html) is turned on in Show Features. Defaults to the patient's Site (set in [Edit Patient Information: Other Tab](patienteditother.html)). Click **[...]** to select the site where the procedure was done. This site determines the default place of service set on the [Edit Claim - General Tab](claimtabgeneral.html). See [Site List](sites.html).

**Place of Service:** Only visible if Public Health is turned on in Show Features. Defaults to the *Default Proc Place of Service*, see [Practice Setup](practice.html), for the practice when creating a new procedure or completing a procedure. Click the dropdown to change.

**Clinics**: If a procedure is attached to an appointment when set complete, the clinic *Default Proc Place of Service* will override the practice *Default Proc Place of Service*. The practice default will be used if the procedure is not attached to an appointment when set complete.

**Billing Note:** Shows on [Statement](statement.html).
