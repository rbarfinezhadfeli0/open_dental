Supernumerary Teeth

Patients with supernumerary teeth can have procedures charted and sent to insurance using the process below.

1. Chart procedure as normal.
2. On the [Procedure](procedureedit.html), change the tooth number.
   * For supernumerary teeth:
     + US users: Valid values are 51-82 and AS-TS
     + Canada and Foreign users: Valid value is 99.
   * Permanent supernumerary tooth numbers add 50 to the tooth number (tooth 1 = 51).
   * Primary supernumerary tooth numbers add an S (tooth A = AS).
3. Click OK and send procedure to insurance.

Procedures for supernumerary teeth do not show on the graphical tooth chart, but they do get billed to insurance. To show a supernumerary tooth on the graphical tooth chart use the [Draw](chartdrawing.html) tool to draw in a tooth.
