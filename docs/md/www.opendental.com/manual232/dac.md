Denturist Association of Canada ( DAC )

See [Canada](canada.html)

Open Dental does not work with the Denturist Association of Canada (DAC), an association with their own codes, fee guides, and claim submission process, because it would entail a large programming effort:

* We would need to program a new set of codes that can only be accessed if the customer has both a password and approval from the DAC.
* We would need to program many new fee guides.
