Adding cards is only allowed when *Prevent saving new cards* is disabled in [PayConnect Setup](payconnectsetup.html).

When adding new cards:

* A temporary $1.00 authorization hold may show on the patient's card statement.
* A token is created for the card, masking the first 12 digits of the card number.
* After the card has been successfully added, it appears in the Credit Card Manage list and is an available payment option in the [Payment](payment.html) window.

Alternatively, new cards can be added when when processing a payment through [PayConnect Window](payconnectpaymentwindow.html) and *Save Token* or *Save Card* is checked.
