Apex is an E-Claims clearinghouse. Apex website: <http://www.apexedi.com>

## Setup

Set up as above, then click OK to save.

## Insurance and Claims

Contact Apex for additional required steps when sending claims electronically using Apex.

If claims are sent as a batch to Apex, preauthorizations and claims must be sent separately ([Send Claims](claimsend.html)). If sent together, Apex will merge the data and reject the preauthorizations for having a date of service.
