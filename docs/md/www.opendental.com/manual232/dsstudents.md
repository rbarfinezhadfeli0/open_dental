For [Dental Schools](dentalschools.html), students are providers who can use Open Dental for charting but may have restricted security permissions. Complete steps 1-4 on [Dental Schools](dentalschools.html) before adding the first student.

To add a student, in the [Dental School Providers](dsproviders.html) window, select a [Dental School Class](dsclasses.html) from the Classes dropdown, select the Students radio button, and click Add.

Enter the student information:

* **ProvNum**: Automatically generated once the student is saved. Cannot be changed.
* **Class**: The student's dental class.
* **Last Name/First Name**: The student's name.
* **Abbr**: Automatically generated using the first four characters of the last name and first initial of first name. Can be changed and does not need to be unique.
* **User Name:** The user name the student uses to [Log On](securitylogin.html) to Open Dental. Defaults to the student's ProvNum but can be manually changed.
* **Password**: Enter a password the student uses to log on to Open Dental. When editing an existing student, the password field is blank. To keep the password the same, leave it blank.
   Students can change their password when they log on. From the [Main Menu](mainmenu.html), click File, [Change Password](changepassword.html).

Click **OK** to save. New students are automatically assigned to the default student user group set in [Dental School Setup](dsusergroupdefaults.html).

To add instructors and other providers, see [Dental School Instructors](dsinstructors.html) and [Dental School Providers](dsproviders.html).
