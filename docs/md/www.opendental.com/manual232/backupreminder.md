Backup Reminder

See [Backup Tool](backuptool.html).

This window will pop up automatically once a month when starting Open Dental.

![](images/backupReminder.png)

This is to remind users to think about [Backups](backups.html), because it's an absolutely critical issue that is often neglected.

For each question, check at least one answer confirming the practice's backup methods. Click OK to close the window.

* If *No backups*, *No proof*, or *No strategy* is selected, users will not be able to continue. Each practice must have a backup method, a way to test the method, and a secondary method.

Note: While not recommended, monthly backup reminders can be disabled in [Global Security Settings](securitysettings.html).

Warnings in red may appear in regards to [Supplemental Backups](supplementalbackups.html).

* If Supplemental Backups are disabled, the "Supplemental Backups are disabled..." warning appears.
* If the network path is not entered in Supplemental Backups, the "Supplemental Backup Network Path..." warning appears.
