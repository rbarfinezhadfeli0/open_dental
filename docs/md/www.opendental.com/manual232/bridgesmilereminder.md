Solutionreach/Smile Reminder Bridge

See [Program Links](programlinks.html).

Smile Reminder has rebranded and is now Solutionreach. Solutionreach is one of the companies that provides [Communication Supplemental Services](../site/vendorssupplementalservices.html#communication) to Open Dental users as well as to users of other dental software products.

They have implemented their own bridge to Open Dental. They will install a program on your server that grabs data from the Open Dental database as needed and uploads it to their server. This bridge has been functional for many years, and a number of our customers use it.
