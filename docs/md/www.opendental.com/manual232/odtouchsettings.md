## Security Options

Security options are used when *Clinical Security* is enabled and a *Frequency* value has been set in [ODTouch Security](odtouchsecurity.html). When the frequency time has been met on the device, the user must validate their credentials.

**Use Fingerprint**: When fingerprints are enabled on the device, the fingerprint can be used to validate credentials. If fingerprints fail, users can enter the pin number instead.

**Reset Pin**: When initially enabling *Clinical Security*, users create a 5-digit pin number on the device. If forgotten or unknown, tap to reset the pin number. The user's Open Dental password is required. Enter a new 5-digit pin number.

**Connectivity Status**: Displays how the device is connected to the database.
