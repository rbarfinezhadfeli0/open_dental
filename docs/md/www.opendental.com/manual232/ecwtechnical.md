eCW Technical

This information is for more technical users of [eClinicalWorks](bridgeeclinicalworks.html).

## Middle Tier

The [Middle Tier](middletier.html) feature works well with eCW integration and is particularly helpful for security for multiple location clinics where displaying the patient in Open Dental is slow due to network speed. In the [Choose Database](choosedatabase.html) window, check the box for Using eCW.

## Backups

It is extremely important to backup data as well as verify backup quality by restoring to a standalone MySQL server running on a different computer. Your backup plan should also include an off-site backup. See [Backups](backups.html).

## Technical Details

This section is for programmers and power users only. It primarily refers to Tight Integration mode.

* See [Command Line Arguments](commandline.html) for information on how eCW communicates with Open Dental.
