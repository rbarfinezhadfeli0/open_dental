Close Out Month

There's nothing that offices officially have to do to close out a month in Open Dental. All financials roll over when the calendar changes, and so does Open Dental. There is also no close out process at the [New Year](newyeartasks.html).

Below are some tasks offices may wish to do at the end of each month, but they are not necessary.

**Run Reports**

The following reports can be run anytime, but should be run at least once a month:

* [Aging of Accounts Receivable (A/R) Report](reportaging.html) (although, this can be run as of any date)
* [Production and Income Reports](reportprodinc.html)

The following reports should be run frequently (at minimum once a month) to ensure claims are getting created, sent, and paid. These reports are key to keeping insurance revenue coming in.

* [Claims Not Sent Report](reportclaimsnotsent.html): List of claims that were generated in Open Dental, but not submitted to insurance.
* [Outstanding Insurance Claims Report](reportoutins.html): Claims that have been submitted to insurance, but have not been paid.
* [Procedures Not Billed to Insurance Report](reportprocsnotbilledins.html): Procedures that have been completed, but no claim has been created for.

**Set Security Lock Dates**

Once reports have been run for a month (or another period), setting a global lock date will prevent users from editing previous entries (e.g., procedures, patient payments, insurance payments, and adjustments) or backdating new items. See [Security Lock Dates](securitylockdates.html) for additional information and instructions for enabling global lock dates.

**Billing**

The [Billing List](billinglist.html) should be run at least once a month to generate statements for patients with outstanding balances.

Before running the Billing List, offices may want to run the [Billing/Finance Charges](financecharges.html) Tool to post any billing or finance charges to accounts prior to generating statements. The Billing/Finance Charge Tool should be run once a month.

The Billing List is designed to default to exclude patients who have been billed within the last month (See [Billing](billing.html) *Include anyone not billed since*). If the default date is not changed, offices can run the Billing List multiple times in the same month (e.g., daily) and the same patient will not get multiple statements.

**Recall List**

The [Recall List](recalllist.html) should also be run at least once a month.

The Recall List is designed to allow offices to prevent patients from receiving multiple reminders in a short period of time. If a patient has just received a reminder, they can be excluded from the Recall List by default. This allows staff to run the recall list multiple times a month (e.g., daily) without sending multiple reminders to the same patient. See [Setup Recall](recallsetup.html) *Also show in list if # of days since* settings for additional information.
