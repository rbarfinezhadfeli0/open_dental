Conversions: Outstanding Claims

See [Use Converted Database](usingodconversion.html).

Most final conversions do not convert outstanding claims. Before claim payments can be received in Open Dental, create each claim.

Note: [Conversions](../site/conversions.html) from EZ Dental and Dentrix convert outstanding primary claims, but not secondary claims.

First, print an outstanding claim report from the old software (as of the final conversion date). In order to start tracking outstanding claims in Open Dental, start recreating these outstanding claims in Open Dental as soon as possible.

As claims are recreated in Open Dental, mark the claim off the printed list. Once all outstanding claims from the old software have been recreated in Open Dental, the [Outstanding Insurance Claims Report](reportoutins.html) and [Accounts Receivable (A/R)](reportaging.html) report can be used and will be accurate.

**To recreate claims in Open Dental**:
 First, verify the patient's insurance benefit information. See [After a Conversion: Verify Insurance](convinspending.html). This ensures insurance estimates are accurate and reduce data entry when entering claim payments.

1. In the [Account Module](account.html), select the procedures and click **New Claim**. This creates the claim to be modified.
2. Change the claim status from *Waiting to Send* to *Sent - Verified*.
3. Change the *Date Sent* to the actual sent date for the claim.
4. Click **OK** to save changes.

Once claim payment has been received, the claim can be processed and payment finalized. See [Receive Claim](claimreceive.html) and [Finalize Insurance Payment](claimpayfinalize.html).
