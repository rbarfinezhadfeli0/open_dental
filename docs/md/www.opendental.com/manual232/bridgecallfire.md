CallFire Bridge

CallFire is an obsolete [Program Link](programlinks.html). Use Open Dental's two-way [Integrated Texting](../site/textintegrated.html) feature instead.

CallFire released an upgraded version of their text messaging interface in 2016. This new version does not integrate with Open Dental. CallFire notified us on December 23, 2015 that they will continue to support their old legacy interface for customers who continue to use it. Open Dental will no longer support the CallFire bridge, so we may not be able to address any issues you encounter.

Known Legacy CallFire Limitations:

* Only for outbound text messages.
* Messages have a 160 character limit.
* Do not use carriage returns (press Enter) or the message will be cut off at the carriage return when the message is sent.
* The following characters are allowed: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, . , : ; ! ? ( ) ~ = + - \ / @ $ # & %. If other characters are used the message will fail.
