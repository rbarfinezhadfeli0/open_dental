Up to three available versions will list.

* **New build for current version:** A minor build update for the currently installed version. Includes all of the latest bug fixes for the version. If the latest stable build is already installed, this option will not be available.
* **New stable version**: This version has gone through the beta testing phase and is considered stable. It will contain new and enhanced features. If the latest stable version is already installed, this option will not be available.
* **New beta version**: This version will contain the newest features, but will likely have some bugs. It is available to all practices, but should only be installed if the practice is willing to take a small risk. We recommend updating to the newest build regularly if this option is chosen. If the latest beta version is already installed, this option will not be available.
