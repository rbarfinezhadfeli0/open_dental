* **Code Range**: Enter the procedure code range the text color will apply to.
* **Text Color / Change**: Select the color to apply.
* **Show previous date** (optional): Check to show the last date one of the procedures within the range was completed. The date (mm/yy) will always be the most recent of any code in that range. To list the most recent date of a specific procedure code, add another range for a single procedure code.

Click OK to save.

Note:

* Changes will be immediately reflected in new appointments. To apply any changes to existing appointments run the Appt Procs tool in [Database Maintenance](databasemaintenance.html), Tools tab.
* Proc Colors can only be used in the Main List of an appointment and cannot display in the Upper Right or Lower Right.
