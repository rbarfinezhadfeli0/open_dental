Texting Terms of Service

See [Texting](textintegratedusage.html).

## Text Messaging

It is the responsibility of the office to obtain consent to send a patient text messages.

Patients can give consent when they manually provide their mobile phone number. This can happen when:

* Creating an appointment via [Web Sched New Patient](webschednewpatsetup.html).
* Filling [Patient Forms](patientform.html).
* Filling [Web Forms](../site/webforms.html).
* Filling forms via [eClipboard](../site/eclipboard.html).

Alternatively, the office can verbally obtain consent. Once received, record the Text OK status in the [Edit Patient Information](patientedit.html) window.

## Patient Responses

**HELP**
 If Open Dental HQ detects a message with a response of HELP, we send back a message with a help link.

**START / OPT IN**
 If a patient has opted out of text messaging, they can opt back in anytime by texting START to the office.

**STOP / OPT OUT**
 Patients can opt out of messages anytime. When a patient responds to a message with STOP, a message is sent back informing the patient they have been opted out and will receive no further messages. This message is also forwarded to the office.

Open Dental HQ has a record of the patient opting out. At the office, the Text OK status for the patient is set to No with a commlog indicating the opt out request. While the office may attempt to continue sending a message, all messages to patients who have opted out are blocked by Open Dental HQ. A patient must text START to allow receiving messages again.
