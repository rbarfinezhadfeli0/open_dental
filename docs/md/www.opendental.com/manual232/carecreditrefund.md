Follow these steps when refunding a CareCredit payment.

In the original CareCredit payment, click **Return**.

When prompted to proceed with the return, click Yes. The payment window closes, and the CareCredit refund portal launches in the web browser.

Note:

* The transaction must be completed within 30 minutes or the request expires.
* Unlike purchase transactions, the web browser can be minimized and work can continue in Open Dental.
* Do not switch patients when issuing a refund. If the patient is changed, the transaction is for the original patient but the transaction posts on the currently selected patient.

1. Enter the patient's CareCredit account number, then click **Next**.

    The patient name is automatically pulled from Open Dental. If the account number is not known, the account may be verified with other patient information.
   * Look Up Account by SSN & Zip: Enter the patient's SSN and verify their zip code. The zip code is automatically pulled from Open Dental. The SSN must be entered manually.
   * Look Up Account by Name & Phone: This information is automatically pulled from Open Dental. Verify it is correct.
2. Complete the Amount & Financing section and click **Submit Transaction**  to finalize the return.

   * **Refund Amount**: The original payment amount is automatically filled in. Edit the amount if refunding a portion of the original payment.
   * **Financing Option**: Select the financing terms setup for the original payment.
   * **Manufacturer**: Select the manufacturer. Options include:
     + ClearCorrect
     + Invisalign
     + Reveal
   * **Practice Memo**: Defaults to the Open Dental payment number of the original transaction. Enable the preference, *Show payment numbers in Account Module* to see the payment numbers at the bottom of each payment note.
3. Print a copy of the receipt for the patient to sign.

    A negative payment with the CareCredit transaction details posts to the account in Open Dental. It may take a few moments to post.
4. Exit the browser to prevent accidentally processing transactions for the wrong patient.
