## Software As a Medical Device (SaMD)

Per Health Canada, Open Dental Software does not need to be classified as a Medical Device as we meet the exclusion criteria below.

The following information can be found in detail here: [Draft Guidance Document - Software as a Medical Device (SaMD)](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/public-involvement-consultations/medical-devices/software-medical-device-draft-guidance/document.html#a22)
*2.2 Exclusion criteria
 The medical purposes described in the device definition of the Act can apply to a wide range of products. However, software that does not have a direct impact on the diagnosis, treatment, or management of an individual's disease, disorder, abnormal physical state or symptoms would not be subject to the Regulations (e.g. a mobile app intended to monitor daily calorie intake and energy expenditure to allow an individual to self-manage their weight).

 It has been Health Canada's longstanding position that the following types of software do not meet the definition of a medical device and are therefore not subject to the Regulations:

* Software intended for administrative support of a healthcare facility,
* Software that enables clinical communication and workflow including patient registration, scheduling visits, voice calling, video calling,
* Software intended for maintaining or encouraging a healthy lifestyle, such as general wellness apps, and
* Software intended to serve as electronic patient records.*
