Register Canadian Providers for E-Claims

For a [Canada](canada.html) user to send claims, providers must be registered with the appropriate organizations.

Please note, Open Dental Support cannot assist with registration, this page is only offered as a courtesy starting point for users.

## Dentists

Each provider should be set up with their province organization.

| Province | Organization |
| --- | --- |
| Alberta | [Alberta Dental Association & College](https://www.dentalhealthalberta.ca/) |
| British Columbia | [British Columbia Dental Association](https://www.bcdental.org/) |
| Manitoba | [Manitoba Dental Association](https://www.manitobadentist.ca/) |
| New Brunswick | [New Brunswick Dental Society](https://www.nbdent.ca/) |
| Newfoundland and Labrador | [Newfoundland and Labrador Dental Association](https://nlda.net/) |
| Nova Scotia | [Nova Scotia Dental Association](https://nsdental.org/) |
| Ontario | [Ontario Dental Association](https://www.oda.ca/) |
| Prince Edward Island | [Dental Association of Prince Edward Island](https://www.dapei.ca/) |
| Quebec | [Association des Chirurgiens dentistes du Quebec](https://www.acdq.qc.ca/en/) |
| Saskatchewan | [College of Dental Surgeons of Saskatchewan](https://saskdentists.com/) |

When a provider joins with their organization, they will automatically access CDA Membership benefits. The exception is Quebec, where providers must maintain a [CDA Membership](https://www.cda-adc.ca/en/about/membership/) separately.

Some carriers may require additional registration.

Once Provincial and CDA Membership has been completed, contact Open Dental to install [ITRANS 2.0](itrans20.html).

## Hygienists

Hygiene-only practices, also known as Independent Practices, should be registered with the Canadian Dental Hygiene Association, as well as their local provincial organization. For more information, see [CDHA Claim Forms and Billing Set-Up](https://www.cdha.ca/cdha/The_Profession_folder/Independent_Practice_folder/Claim_Forms__UIN_Application_folder/CDHA/The_Profession/Independent_Practice/Claim_Forms.aspx).

To send electronic claims, hygienists (independent practitioners) may also need to register with TELUS and Express Scripts.

Some carriers may require additional registration.

Once CDHA, TELUS, and Express Scripts registration is complete, contact Open Dental to install [CCDWS](ccdws.html) to send claims, known in Open Dental as [Claimstream](claimstream.html).

## Mixed Practices

If a practice has both Dentists and Independent Dental Hygiene Practitioners, and they are sharing a single database, use ITRANS 2.0 for claims.
