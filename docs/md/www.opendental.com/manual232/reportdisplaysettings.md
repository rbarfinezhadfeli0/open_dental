Alternatively, from the [Standard Reports](reportsstandard.html) window, click [Setup](reportssetup.html) in the upper left. Open the Display Settings tab.

Report display settings control the appearance of the Standard Reports window, including which reports are listed, the sort order of reports, and report name.

All available reports will list, grouped by category, and sorted in the order they will appear on the Reports window.

**Up**/**Down** Arrows: Use to sort reports in a category. Select a report and click **Up** or **Down** to move the position in the list. Reports can only be reordered within a category, not moved to a different category.

**Display Name**: Report name. This can be changed. Click the *Display Name* cell and type a new name. The internal name of the report will always list in the lower-right of the setup window when a report is highlighted.
