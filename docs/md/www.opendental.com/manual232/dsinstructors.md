Dental School Instructors

Each instructor should be added in Open Dental as a provider.

In [Dental School Providers](dsproviders.html), double-click an existing Instructor to edit.

For [Dental Schools](dentalschools.html), instructors are providers who can also fill out [Dental Student Evaluations](dsevaluations.html). Complete steps 1-4 on [Dental Schools](dentalschools.html) before adding the first instructor.

Note: Existing providers or students cannot be designated as instructors, instead create a new instructor.

To add instructors, in the [Dental School Providers](dsproviders.html) window, select the Instructors radio button, and click Add.

Enter the instructors information on the Edit [Provider](providerseditwindow.html), General tab.

On the Dental Schools tab, enter the user name and password the instructor will use to [Log On](securitylogin.html) to Open Dental.

* **ProvNum**: Automatically generated once the instructor is saved. Cannot be changed.
* **User Name**: Defaults to the instructor's ProvNum but can be manually changed.
* **Password**: When editing an existing instructor, the password field will be blank. To keep the password the same, leave it blank.
   Instructors can change their password when they log on. From the [Main Menu](mainmenu.html), click File, [Change Password](changepassword.html).

Click **OK** to save. New instructors are automatically assigned to the default instructor user group set in [Dental School Setup](dsusergroupdefaults.html).

To add other providers and students, see [Dental School Providers](dsproviders.html) and [Dental School Students](dsstudents.html).
