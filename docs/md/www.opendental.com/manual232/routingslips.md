Routing Slips

Open Dental is designed for use in a paperless office, but there are still some offices that like to use printed routing slips.

In [Standard Reports](reportsstandard.html), in the *Daily* section, click **Routing Slips**.

From here Open Dental can print a batch of routing slips for all appointments for an entire day. To customize routing slips, see [Routing Slip Layout](sheetsroutingslips.html).

**Providers:** Highlight the Providers to print routing slips for. Check All to select all providers.
**Clinics:** Highlight the clinics to print routing slips for. Check All to select all clinics, including clinics marked as hidden.
**Date:** Enter the date. Click **Today** to insert today's date, or **Displayed** to insert the current date shown in the Appointments Module.

Note:

* To control user access to this report, see [Report Setup: Security Permissions](reportsecurity.html).
* If there is more than one custom routing slip in Open Dental, the first one listed alphabetically in [Sheets](sheets.html) will be used.

Routing slips can also be printed from the [Appointments Module](appointments.html):

* To print a routing slip for a single appointment, right-click on an appointment and click **Routing Slip**.
* To print routing slips for multiple appointments at once, click the Print icon in the toolbar:
  + Click **All for Day** to print routing slips for all appointments for the selected day, regardless of the selected Appointment View.
  + Click **Current View Only** to print routing slips for only appointments visible in the selected Appointment View for the selected day.

Below is an example of the internal Routing Slip.
