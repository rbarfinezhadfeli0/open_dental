Create AtoZ Folder

In the [Main Menu](mainmenu.html), click Tools, Misc Tools, Create A to Z Folders.

![](images/atozCreate.png)

This tool is used to create a blank [OpenDentImages](atozfolder.html) folder.

Note:

* An OpenDentImages folder is created upon initial installation of Open Dental, so this tool is rarely used.
* This tool cannot be accessed by Open Dental Cloud users.

**Location of new folder**: Enter the location for the new OpenDentImages folder. When a new folder is created, the [Data Path](paths.html) automatically updates to the new location. If an OpenDentImages folder already exists in the entered location, an error prevents a new folder from being created.

**Folder name**: Typically *OpenDentImages*.

Click **Save** to run the tool.
