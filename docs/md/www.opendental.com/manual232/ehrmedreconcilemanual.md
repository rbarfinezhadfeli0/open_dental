EHR Reconcile from Paper Document

If you receive a paper document of a patient's medications, allergies, or problems from another provider, you can manually reconcile them with the patient's medication, allergy, and problem list in Open Dental. For another reconcile option, see [EHR: Reconciling from an Imported Summary of Care](ehrmedreconcileelectronic.html).

1. Scan the document and save it as an image file (e.g. JPG, PNG, GIF) in an Images folder.
2. On the [EHR Dashboard](ehrdashboard1.html), click **Manual Reconciliation**.

3. Highlight the provider from whom the document came, then click OK to select. To add new [Referrals](referrals.html) click Add. The referral must be marked as *Is Doctor*. All referrals marked as *Doctor* will also show a **Specialty**.

   The medications in the patient's medication list show in the upper right.
