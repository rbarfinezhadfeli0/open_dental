* **Name**: Enter the item name. This identifies the item in the quick add list.
* **ADA Code(s)**: Enter the procedure code or group of codes associated with the item. This field is case sensitive so enter the code as it appears in the [Procedure Codes](procedurecodes.html) list.
  + To enter more than one code, separate each code with a comma and do not add spaces (e.g., D0140,D0220).
  + To associate a tooth number with the procedure, place the tooth number at the end of the code (e.g., D0220#7). The procedure code must have the treatment area set to *Tooth*. To enter the same code on multiple teeth, enter the code multiple times for each tooth (e.g., D0220#7, D0220#8, etc.)
  + Procedures with a treatment area other than *Mouth* or *Tooth* (when the tooth number is specified) should not be added to a Appt Procs Quick Add definition as users are not prompted to enter the treatment area.

Click **OK** to save.
