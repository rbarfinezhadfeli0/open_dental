For carriers that accept electronic attachments, Canada users can submit an eligibility request.

## Setup

To begin sending electronic eligibility requests, the following must be set up first.

* Set the default eligibility clearinghouse in [Clearinghouses](clearinghouses.html).
* Ensure the carrier for the patient supports eligibility.
* Check that the patient's Primary Provider is set to a valid CDA provider in [Edit Patient Information](patientedit.html).
* For the patient, set the Eligibility Excep. Code in the [Edit Patient Information: Other Tab](patienteditother.html). For most patients, use option 4. Cannot be left as option 0.
