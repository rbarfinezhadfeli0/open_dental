* **eService Activity Log**: Opens the [eService Activity Log](eserviceactivitylog.html) to view actions tracked by eServices.
* **Unfinalized Payments**: Shows the number of outstanding unfinalized payments in parentheses, e.g., *(3)* . Click to open the [Unfinalized Insurance Payment Report](reportunfinalizedinsurancepayments.html). The [Open Dental Service](opendentalservice.html) must be installed and running for the number of unfinalized payments to display.

Other Reports in Open Dental:

* To add a click-able URL as a Reports menu option, see [Custom Bridges](bridgecustom.html).
* [Appointment Lists](appointmentlists.html)
* Accounting reports (General Ledger Detail and Balance Sheets). See [Accounting Close Year](accountingcloseyear.html).
* Clearinghouse reports. See [Send Claims](claimsend.html).
* [Arizona Reports](../resources/Arizona.txt)
* Custom Reports: Some users may have a Custom Reports menu item. It means there is a reports folder within the [A to Z Folder](atozfolder.html) (typically Reports) that contains at least one .rdl file (e.g., Unsched Treat Plans.rdl). There is one menu item for each .rdl file in the folder.

Note:

* For offices that converted from another software, reports should not be run on or prior to the conversion date.
* Report processing/generation time may vary depending on the complexity and type of report being run.
