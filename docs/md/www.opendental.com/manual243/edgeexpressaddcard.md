Alternatively, in [Payment](payment.html) select Add Card from the Credit Card dropdown.

Credit and debit cards can be added to a patient account without processing a payment through [Edge Express](edgeexpress.html).

When adding a new card, swipe the card or manually enter the card information.

* Click **Yes** to swipe the patient's card using the terminal.
* Click **No** to type in the patient's card information manually. CVV and Customer Information are optional.

Note: If the card information is not added within 5 minutes, the session times out and the process must be restarted

.

A token is created for the card, masking the first 12 digits of the card number. The card is listed in the Credit Card Manage window and is available as a payment option in the [Payment](payment.html) window.

Once a card is added, it can be set up to [Authorize Recurring Charges](recurringchargesauthorize.html).
