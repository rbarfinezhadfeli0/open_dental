All provider types can be added and edited in the Provider List.

For [Dental Schools](dentalschools.html), there are three types of providers:

* [Dental School Instructors](dsinstructors.html): Can create student evaluations.
* [Dental School Students](dsstudents.html): Usually have less security permissions.
* Other providers (see [Providers](providers.html)).

To define the security permissions each type has, see [Dental School Security](dssecurity.html).

To set up school requirements, see [Dental School Requirements Needed](requirements.html).

**Providers Grid**: Displays providers matching search criteria.

* X in the *Instructor* column indicates the provider is a Dental School Instructor.
* A class name in the *Class* column indicates the provider is a Dental School Student.
* Check **Show Hidden** to view providers in the list marked as *Hidden*.
* Check **Show Merged** to view providers removed during a [Provider Merge](mergeproviders.html). Deleted providers display in red and their information can be viewed but not edited
