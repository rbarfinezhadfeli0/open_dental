Anesthesia

See [Program Links](programlinks.html).

A complete Anesthesia system for Open Dental is available from Big Idea Software, LLC. It offers electronic anesthetic records for both IV and GA cases, and an inventory system for keeping track of scheduled anesthetic medications.

A trial version may be downloaded from Big Idea's website at [www.bigideasoft.com](http://www.bigideasoft.com).

Big Idea Software, LLC created and maintains this program. While it is compatible with Open Dental, we do not offer support for it.
