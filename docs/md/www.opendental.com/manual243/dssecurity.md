For [Dental Schools](dentalschools.html), students, instructors, and other providers are assigned to [User Groups](securityusergroups.html), and each group has specific security [Permissions](permissions.html) that determine a user's access to various features.

## User Groups and Security Permissions

Create at least three types of user groups and carefully consider which [Security](security.html) permissions each group should have.

* **Admin users**: Typically have access to most if not all permissions, including:
  + *Security Admin*: Define users, user groups, security permissions.
  + *Setup*: Access to setup functions, including dental courses and classes.
  + *Instructor Edit*: Create and edit providers that are instructors.
  + *Student Edit*: Create and edit providers that are students.
  + *Admin Evaluation Edit*: View and edit student evaluations; cannot create.
* **Instructors**: All instructors have the ability to create student evaluations; this is not related to a security permission. To set up evaluations, the instructor user group should have the *Setup* security permission.
* **Students**: Students should not have access to permissions that involve system setup or security.

To create a user group and assign security permissions, see [User Group](securityusergroups.html).

## Assign Students and Instructors a User Group

After creating user groups, assign the default student and instructor groups in [Dental School Setup](dsusergroupdefaults.html). This determines the user group assignment when adding each new student or instructor.

## User names and passwords

Each student, instructor, and other providers need a unique user name and password to [Log On](securitylogin.html) to Open Dental. These are assigned when adding the providers:

* For instructors, see [Dental School Instructors](dsinstructors.html).
* For students, see [Dental School Students](dsstudents.html).
* For other providers, see [Dental School Providers](dsproviders.html).
