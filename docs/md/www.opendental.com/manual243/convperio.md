Conversions: Perio

See [Use Converted Database](usingodconversion.html).

During a final [Conversion](../site/conversions.html), we default every patient to a 6 month Prophy recall type. Before we deliver the final conversion, we run a script that changes all patients with completed procedures for D4910, D4341, and D4342 in the last three years to a four-month Perio recall.

To view a report of which patients were converted to Perio to go  [User Query Favorites](queryfavorites.html). Double-click the *Conv - Perio Patients* query

Change an individual patient's recall in the [Family Module](family.html), [Recall](recall.html) area.

To change default intervals, see [Recall Types](recalltypes.html). Be cautious when editing recall types as changes affect the entire recall system.
