## NEA/Manual Tab

The NEA/Manual Tab is used to document attachments sent to NEA *Fast*Attach or other third-party services.

Note:

* NEA *Fast*Attach was acquired by Vyne Dental and is an option for electronic attachments. For *Fast*Attach registration and download see: <https://vynedental.com/fastattach/>.
* This box is grayed out if *Allow Attachments* is enabled in the default [Clearinghouse](clearinghouses.html) setup.

**Radiographs, Oral Images and Models**: Enter how many pages will be sent for each item. This information shows on paper claims and e-claims.

**EOB, Narrative, Perio chart, Misc Support Data**: Check the items that will be sent with the claim. This information shows on e-claims.

**By Mail/Electronically**: Select how the attachments will be sent.

**Attachment ID Number**: If there is an attachment ID that must be included before sending the claim, enter it here. The ID is prepended to the Notes field and goes out on the e-claim in a special field for attachments. If using NEA *Fast*Attach with ClaimConnect, the NEA# is inserted into the claim after the claim has been sent.

**Attached Images**: Select the images that will be sent as attachments, then export them to a temporary folder. Attachments added here are for reference only and are not sent by Open Dental. They must be sent separately using a third-party service.

* Click **Add** to select an image from the [Imaging Module](images.html).
* Click **Perio** to attach the most recent [Perio Exam](perio.html).

As images are added, they are listed in the box.

* Double-click on any attachment to view the image.
* Right-click to open, rename, or remove.
* Click **Export** to send all listed attachments to the folder defined in the preference, *Claim Attachment Export Path*.
* Import the images from the temporary folder to the attachment service (e.g., to NEA *Fast*Attach).
