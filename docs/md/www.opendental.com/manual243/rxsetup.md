Rx / Prescriptions List

Use the prescription list to create templates for prescriptions that the practice commonly writes.

In the [Main Menu](mainmenu.html), click Lists, Prescriptions.

The template can include dosage, refills allowed, notes, and drug interaction alerts based on medications, problems, and/or allergies. Templates can be freely deleted or changed without changing any patient data. Users can also write prescriptions that are not in this list, so not every possible prescription must be added.
