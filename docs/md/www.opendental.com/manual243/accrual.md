Accrual Accounting

Most small dental offices use cash-basis [Accounting](accounting.html) rather than accrual-basis accounting. This page is an attempt to discuss how to use Open Dental in an accrual-basis accounting scenario.

**Current Guidelines**

1. In [Global Security Settings](securitysettings.html), use the lock date feature to prevent users from making changes.
2. After locking, run monthly reports. Never unlock to make historical changes.
3. PPO write-offs: See [Report Setup: Misc Settings](reportmiscsettings.html), where it discusses the option for *Default selected date for PPO write-offs*. Set to *Insurance Pay Date* to avoid changing history.

To keep track of prepayments, see [Unearned / Prepayment](unearnedprepayment.html).

Also see the [Unearned Allocation Report](reportunearnedallocation.html).
