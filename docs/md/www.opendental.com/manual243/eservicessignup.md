Hover the mouse over a service to view service description and terms. Check the box next to each service to enable it.

* When eServices Bundle is selected, boxes for all services included in the [eServices Bundle](eservicesbundle.html) (all eServices excluding ODTouch) are checked. The Total $ amounts automatically update to reflect fees.
* Integrated Texting access fee is included with eConfirmations. Per outgoing message fees still apply.
* Patient Portal and Web Forms are free for those on support. Thus, in the Signup Portal, these options are always checked.

Click **Save**. New charges are reflected within two billing cycles.

## Discontinue a Service

To discontinue a service, uncheck its box in the Signup Portal and click Save. Click the Info box in the upper right to see the Next Bill Date.

When discontinuing a service, access to the service is available for the remainder of the day.
