Alternatively, in the [EHR Dashboard](ehrdashboard1.html), click **Provide Online Access** next to the *ElectronicCopyAccess* measure.

Before access can be granted:

* Patient Portal must be enabled in the [eServices Signup](eservicessignup.html) Portal.
* The *Patient Portal* row must first be added to Chart Patient Information in [Display Fields](displayfields.html).
* The patient must have a name, address, date of birth, email address, and phone number entered in the Family Module.

**Setup**: Click to open [Patient Portal](portalhostedbyod.html) settings.

**Provide Online Access**: Displays when a patient does not have access. Click to automatically generate a user name and password.

**Remove Online Access**. Displays when a patient has access. Click to remove the patient's ability to login to the portal.

**Patient Facing URL**: The patient portal web address. Click **Open** to open the URL in a web browser.

**Online Username**: Defaults to the patient's first name plus a random number. The user name is not case sensitive. Patients can change their username after logging into Patient Portal.

**Online Password**: Displays the generated password or asterisks if a password already exists. The password is case sensitive.

* Click **Generate New** to assign a random 8-digit one-time use password.
* One-time use passwords generated by Open Dental are valid until the patient changes their password, or until a different password is generated in Open Dental (manually or via a sheet or invitation).
* The office staff can manually change a password by typing in the field. Passwords must be at least 8 characters and have one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number.
* Patients can change their password after logging into Patient Portal.

**Print**: Generate a printout of the user name, password, and the patient portal URL to give to the patient.

## Alternative Methods to Grant Access

Option 1: Set up Patient Portal Invites which can be sent via email before or after a scheduled appointment. See [Edit Rule](editrule.html), Patient Portal Invites section for details.

Option 2: Generate a [Sheet](sheets.html) that has the *patientPortalCredentials* [Sheet Static Text Field](sheetsstatictext.html) on it.

* The credentials only display on the sheet if the patient does not have online access at the time the sheet was created.
