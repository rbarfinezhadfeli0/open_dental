EHR CQMs Not Performed

When you document [EHR Interventions](ehrinterventions.html) for an eligible patient encounter, it counts towards [EHR Clinical Quality Measures](ehrcqm.html). If an intervention or action is not performed, you can document the reason. Interventions and reasons not performed are usually documented while entering patient [EHR Vital Signs](vitalsignsenter.html) or [Smoking Status](smokingenter.html).

To view all *not performed reasons* for a patient, or manually add reasons.

1. On the [EHR Dashboard](ehrdashboard1.html), click **Not Performed**.
