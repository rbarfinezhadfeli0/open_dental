Messaging

Internal messaging can be used to send messages to any, or all workstations in an office.

In the [Manage Module](manage.html), at the bottom, is the Messaging area.

Messages can include text, sound and/or light. They can be To and From specific users, but everyone will see or hear it. For example, a message can be sent to all computers that says *Doctor, Spouse, Line 1*. Or a message could be sent that says *Doctor, Op 1* with an accompanying message button that lights up.

**To, From, Extras, Message (& Send)**: These columns list the [Message Elements](messagingelements.html). Several messaging elements come preset in Open Dental, but they can be customized or have new elements added.

To send a message:

1. Click on a **To**, **From**, and/or **Extra Item**. Each element is optional.
2. Click an item in **Message (& Send)** to immediately send it.

**Custom Message**: Enter a custom message, then click **Send Message**. Highlight a To, From, and/or Extra element prior to sending the message to include them. Messages have a character limit of 255.

## Message History

All sent messages show in the Message History until they are acknowledged.

**Include Acknowledged:** Check to view messages that have been acknowledged. A field labeled **Days** will appear. Enter the number of days for which you want to see acknowledged messages. For example, enter 1 in the Days field to see acknowledged messages only for the last one day.

**Ack**: Highlight one or more messages, then click to acknowledge it. Every message should be acknowledged. If the message triggered a messaging button, you can also click on the lit button to acknowledge it. Acknowledged messages older than two days are deleted from the database once per week.

**To User**: Filter messages by user. By default, all users are shown in the list.
