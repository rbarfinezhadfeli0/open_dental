Integrated Texting Troubleshooting

Below is some general help if you experience issues with [Integrated Texting](textintegratedusage.html).

Other resources:

* [eReminder and eConfirmation Troubleshooting](eremindertroubleshooting.html)
* [Web Sched Troubleshooting](webschedtroubleshooting.html)
* [Appointment Texts](appointmenttexts.html)

**Problem: Text messages show a status of *Pending*.**

It is likely the eConnector was down when texts were first sent.

1. Go to eServices, eConnector.
2. Acknowledge any errors.
3. Refresh the eConnector.

* If no errors show and the eConnector status is working, then the text messages have gone through.
* If the eConnector still has an error, contact Support for assistance or see [eServices Troubleshooting](eservicestroubleshooting.html).

There is a waiting period when an office switches to a landline number. Texts will have a pending status until the number has been confirmed by Open Dental HQ.

Text messages may continue to show a status of Pending, even if they have successfully sent.

**Problem: Patients aren't receiving text messages.**

Suggestions:

* First send yourself a test text message.
* If the message to yourself does not go through, contact support. If it does goes through, send the patient another text message to ensure it wasn't a temporary issue.
* If the patient still doesn't receive the message, contact support for further troubleshooting.

**Some text messages have a status of failed or I received a text stating "Delivery Failure Receipt." What do I need to do?**

It's likely you tried to send a message to a recipient (patient) with an invalid wireless phone in Edit Patient Information. The common causes for this are:

* Recipient phone is a landline.
* Recipient country code and/or area code are incorrect.
* Recipient country code is not eligible to receive messages from this practice.
* Patient phone number is formatted incorrectly.

To fix this, edit the patient's wireless phone and try again. If you receive these error messages frequently and are unable to fix the issue, please contact support.

**Problem: Can't delete text message commlog.**

Information: Commlogs are created whenever a text is sent or received. Sent text commlogs can be deleted, however received text commlogs cannot because they are directly tied to the received text.

**Problem: Some manual text messages are not delivered to the patient.**

Manual text messages that include URLs (e.g., webform links) can be blocked by the carrier. Links should only be sent if they are generated and sent by the Open Dental [Automated Messaging Feature](../site/ereminders.html) (e.g., Web Sched).
