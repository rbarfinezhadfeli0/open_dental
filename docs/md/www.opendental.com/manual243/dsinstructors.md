Dental School Instructors

Each instructor should be added in Open Dental as a provider.

In [Dental School Providers](dsproviders.html), double-click an existing Instructor to edit.

For [Dental Schools](dentalschools.html), instructors are providers who can also fill out [Dental Student Evaluations](dsevaluations.html). Complete steps 1-4 on [Dental Schools](dentalschools.html) before adding the first instructor.

Note: Existing providers or students cannot be designated as instructors. Instead, create a new instructor.

To add instructors, in the [Dental School Providers](dsproviders.html) window, select the *Instructors* radio button and click **Add**.

Enter the instructor's information on the Edit [Provider](providerseditwindow.html), General tab.

On the Dental Schools tab, enter the user name and password for the instructor to use to [Log In](securitylogin.html) to Open Dental.

* **ProvNum**: Automatically generated once the instructor is saved. Cannot be changed.
* **User Name**: Defaults to the instructor's ProvNum but can be manually changed. Changes are reflected in [Security](security.html).
* **Password**: When editing an existing instructor, the password field is blank. To keep the password the same, leave it blank.
   Instructors can change their password when they log on. From the [Main Menu](mainmenu.html), click File, [Change Password](changepassword.html).

Click **Save** to create the instructor or keep changes. New instructors are automatically assigned to the default instructor user group set in [Dental School Setup](dsusergroupdefaults.html) and added as a user in Security Setup.

To add other providers and students, see [Dental School Providers](dsproviders.html) and [Dental School Students](dsstudents.html).
