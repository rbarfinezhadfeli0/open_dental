ADA Claim Forms

Below is an explanation of how each field on the printed ADA 2012, 2018, 2019, and 2024 [Claim Forms](claimforms.html) are populated.

Note:

* The requirements for e-claims are different than the requirements for paper claims. Printing a claim does not represent what is sent in an e-claim. Likewise, information sent in an e-claim does not necessarily print on a paper claim.
* The 2012 and 2018/2019 claims forms are nearly identical. The few changes are noted in their respective fields.
* The 2024 claim form added new fields. These new fields are noted in their respective fields.
* Also see [Claim Addresses](claimsaddresses.html) for details on entering address and phone information.
