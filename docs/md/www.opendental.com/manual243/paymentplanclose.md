Close Payment Plans

The Close Payment Plans tool allows offices to easily close out all payment plans with a zero balance and no future charges.

In the [Main Menu](mainmenu.html), click Tools, Misc Tools, Close Payment Plans.

This tool is helpful if the practice has payment plans showing in the [Payment Plan Report](reportpaymentplan.html) that have zero balance, no future charges, but are not closed.

Once the tool is clicked, the above is displayed. By default, running the tool closes [Payment Plans](paymentplandynamic.html) with zero balance or a negative balance and no future charges. Choose additional options to include other payment plan types.

**Include Old Payment Plans**: Determine if [Old Payment Plans](paymentplanpatient.html) are included in addition to Payment Plans when running the tool.

* Checked: Old Payment Plans with zero balance or a negative balance, no future charges, and no treatment planned procedures.
* Unchecked: Old Payment Plans are not closed when running the tool.

**Include Insurance Payment Plans**: Determine if [Insurance Payment Plans](paymentplanins.html) are included when running the tool in addition to Payment Plans.

* Checked: Insurance Payment Plans with zero balance or a negative balance, no future charges, and no treatment planned procedures.
* Unchecked: Insurance Payment Plans are not closed when running the tool.

Click **Save** to continue and close all plans that meet the criteria.

A confirmation appears once payment plans have finished closing, indicating the number of payments plans closed. If no payments plans met the criteria, a message appears instead indicating "*There were no plans to close.*"
