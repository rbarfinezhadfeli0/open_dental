From the Appt Print Setup window, customize the print settings for the appointment schedule or print Routing Slips for the day.

## Print Appointments

* **Start / Stop Time**: Enter the time span to print appointments.
* **Operatories per page**: Directly affects how many pages are printed and scales the size of the Operatories printed. More Operatories per page results in fewer printed pages. If the *Operatories per page* exceeds the number of Operatories in the selected [Appointment View](appointmentviews.html), the printout includes blank space. Adjust the *Operatories per page* to match the number of Operatories in the Appointment View to scale the full page.
* **Font Size**: Affects how many pages are printed.
* **Color**: Determine how to print the appointments. Useful for saving colored ink.

+ **Full color**: Operatories, Blockouts, and appointments boxes print in solid color as they appear on screen.
+ **Less color**: Operatories with Blockouts with be printed with a crosshatch in the corresponding Blockout color. Closed Operatories print with a crosshatch in the corresponding color. Appointments print in white.
+ **Grayscale**: Printed without color. Operatories with Blockouts show a crosshatch and closed Operatories show a crosshatch going the opposite direction. Appointments print in white.

* **Orientation**: Determine the orientation to print the schedule.
  + **Landscape**: Print in landscape.
  + **Portrait**: Print in portrait.
* **Save**: Save settings for the next time the schedule is printed.
* **Preview**: Review the print output.
* **Print**: Print the appointment schedule for the day. Prints the currently selected Appointment View.

Note: The current setting for Day or Week view in the Appointments Module determines if a daily or weekly list is printed. Time increments and rows per increment set in [Appointment View Setup](appointmentviewsetup.html) can affect printing. If too many pages are still printing, increase the time increment or set the rows per increment to one.

## Print Routing Slips

Print Routing Slips for appointments on the schedule for the selected day. Not available if Headquarters is the selected Clinic, or if Week view is selected.

* **All for Day**: Print all Routing Slips for appointments assigned to the selected Clinic on the selected day.
* **Current View Only**: Print Routing Slips for the selected Appointment View only.

If multiple [Routing Slip Layouts](sheetsroutingslips.html) exist in [Sheets](sheets.html), the top-most option in the custom grid is used. If there are no custom Routing Slip layouts, the internal Routing Sheet is used.
