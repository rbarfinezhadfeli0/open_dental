Setting ODTouch security options helps ensure a device is not accessible if it is set down and forgotten.

* **Enable Clinical Security**: Check to enable ODTouch security options.
* **Frequency (Minutes)**: Enter the amount of time, in minutes, that a user is required to validate their credentials. Validation is done via pin number or a fingerprint scan, depending on options enabled in [ODTouch: Settings](odtouchsettings.html). If validation is required while the device is in use, the user can finish their current action before validating their credentials.

Click OK to save.
