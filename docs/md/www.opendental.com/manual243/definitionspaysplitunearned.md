The PaySplit Unearned Type definition determines the list of [Unearned](unearnedprepayment.html) Type options available in the [Paysplit](paysplit.html) window.

By default, the Prepayment unearned type is used when a payment is posted to an account with a credit or no balance and when the Prepay button is clicked in the payment window. To change the default type, see the *Default unearned type for unallocated paysplits* in Preferences.

Double-click an existing item or click **Add** to create a new item. The Edit Definition window opens.
