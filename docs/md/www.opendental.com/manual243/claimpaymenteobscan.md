Scan EOB

The Insurance Payment (EOB) window is described at the bottom of both [Finalize Insurance Payment](claimpayfinalize.html) and [Batch Insurance Payment](claimpaymentbatch.html). In the lower-left corner is an area indicating if the EOB is already scanned.

* If an EOB is not scanned (No), click **Scan EOB** to scan the EOB.
* If an EOB is already scanned (Yes), click **View** to view the EOB.
* Click **View ERA** to see any [ERA](era.html) associated with the claim.

Open Dental recommends entering all EOB information (including remarks) with payment details so staff can refer to and access it when needed. If a patient asks why insurance did not pay as expected, users can quickly determine which procedures were not paid and why.
