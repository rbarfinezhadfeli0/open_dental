Task Inbox Setup

Assign Task Lists to users as inboxes.

In [Tasks Preferences](tasksetup.html), click **Inbox Setup**.

![](images/taskInboxSetup.png)

Inboxes determine which Task Lists are listed by default when clicking *Send To...* on a [Task](taskswindow.html) and which Task List a task is sent to when clicking *Reply* on a task.

[Users](securityusers.html) and [Task Lists](tasklists.html) must be created before assigning Task Inboxes.

**User / Inbox grid**: Displays users and the Task List that is currently assigned as an inbox.

**Task Lists**: Displays all Task Lists that are not archived.

To assign an inbox to a user:

1. Highlight the user in the User / Inbox grid (on the left).
2. Highlight the Task List to be assigned as an inbox from the Task Lists (on the right).
   * To unassign a user from any inbox, highlight *none*.
3. Click **Set**.

The selected Task List is now assigned as the selected user's inbox. If the user was already assigned a different inbox, it is replaced with the new Task List.

Once an inbox is assigned, users should subscribe to the Task List from the [Tasks Area](tasksarea.html) to get task popups or show tasks in the New for User and For User tabs.
