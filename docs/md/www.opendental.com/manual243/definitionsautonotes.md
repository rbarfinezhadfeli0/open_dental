Definitions: Auto Note Categories

Organize Auto Notes using Auto Note Categories.

In the [Main Menu](mainmenu.html), click Setup, [Definitions](definitions.html), Auto Note Categories.

![](images/definitionsAutoNotes.png)

The Auto Note Categories definition determines which category folders are available to organize [Auto Notes](autonotes.html). This list is empty by default. Add categories as needed.

Categories can be nested within each other. If a category is nested in another category, the containing category is listed as the *Parent Category*.

To change the order of the categories as viewed in the auto note window, see [Auto Note Setup](autonotesetup.html). Changing the order in the Definitions window does not change the view in the Auto Notes window.

Double-click an existing item to edit or click **Add** to create a new item. The Edit Definition window opens.

* **Name**: Enter the category folder name.
* **Parent Category**: (Optional) Click **[...]** to open the Definition Picker (see below) and select a containing category to nest this category into. Click the red **X** to disassociate the Parent Category. Categories can also be nested from Setup, Auto Notes.
![](images/definitionAutoNotePicker.png)* **Delete**: Permanently remove the Auto Note Category definition. Auto Notes sorted in the category are not deleted and will no longer be categorized in the Auto Notes list.

Click **Save** to close the window and keep changes
