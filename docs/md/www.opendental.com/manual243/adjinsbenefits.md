Adjustments to Insurance Benefits

Adjustments to Insurance Benefits can be added when a patient uses benefits outside of the practice.

In an [Insurance Plan](insplan.html), in the upper right, click **Add**.

Alternatively, in the [Insurance Plan](insplan.html), double-click an existing adjustment to edit.

This adjusts the benefits used to reflect proper [Insurance Remaining Calculations](insremainingcalc.html) and [Treatment Plan](treatmentplan.html) estimates. Once the patient's benefit year is up, the amount entered no longer affects estimates. It remains listed in the insurance plan for future reference.

Adjustments to Insurance Benefits can be used in the following scenarios:

* The patient had treatment done at another office.
* Entering benefits used for received claims that did not convert from another software.
* The patient has rollover benefits from a prior benefit year.
* The practice does not receive *Assignment of Benefits* for the insurance and wants to account for benefits used.

Enter the adjustment information:

* **Date**: The date the adjustment is made. Make sure it falls within the correct benefit year.
* **Insurance Used**: The total amount of insurance used. Negative numbers are allowed to indicate rollover amounts available from the previous benefit year.
* **Deductible Used**: The deductible amount used.

Click **Save** to add the adjustment or keep changes.

Added insurance adjustments display in the upper-right of the insurance plan.

Note: *Ins Used* calculations total all insurance adjustments added within the benefit year. For example, if a patient uses benefits outside the office on two separate occasions within their benefit year, add two separate Adjustment to Insurance Benefits entries.
