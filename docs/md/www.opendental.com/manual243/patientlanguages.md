Language translations can be added to sheets (see [Language Translations for Sheets](sheetsetuplanguage.html)) and automated text messages (see [Automated Messaging](automatedmessaging.html)). When the patient has a language assigned, and these features have a translation in the same language, the language translation is automatically selected for the patient.
