Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP)

See: [DoseSpot eRx / Prescription](dosespotuse.html)

The Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) helps providers manage prescriptions for their patients. When a patient is selected in Open Dental, the provider can launch the patient in PDMP to view prescription information.

## Bridges

There are two bridges available in Open Dental for PDMP. Users should enable the bridge that corresponds with their state.

* Users in California, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, Utah, and Washington should enable the [PDMP Bridge](bridgepdmpillinois.html).
* Users in other states may consider the [Bamboo Bridge](bridgeappriss.html).

## eRx

Both [Ensora eRx (formerly NewCrop eRx)](../site/newcropfeature.html) and [DoseSpot](dosespotuse.html) have Appriss integrations for all states.

Bamboo, previously named Appriss, credentials are vendor specific. Credentials created when signing up through Ensora eRx or DoseSpot will not transfer to or work within Open Dental.

## Requirements

To launch PDMP, the following must be set:

* [Providers](providerseditwindow.html) must have a First Name, Last Name, DEA Number, and National Provider ID entered.
* [Patients](patientedit.html) must have a First Name, Last Name, Birthdate, and Zip Code entered.
* The logged-on [User](securityusers.html) must be associated with a provider.
* The [Open Dental Service](opendentalservice.html) must be installed and running.
