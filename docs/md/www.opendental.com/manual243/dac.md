Denturist Association of Canada ( DAC )

See [Canada](canada.html)

DAC members are welcome to use Open Dental. Although we do not currently work with the DAC to provide service codes and fee guides for denturists, Open Dental software is DACnet certified for electronic claim submission and can pre-fill most fields on the DAC claim form.

* Denturists need to manually enter service codes and fee guides as needed.
* Denturists using their own Open Dental database send electronic claims through DACnet using [Claimstream](claimstream.html).
* Denturists working out of a dentist office's database use [ITRANS 2.0](itrans20.html).
* Contact us for a printable copy of the DAC claim form.
