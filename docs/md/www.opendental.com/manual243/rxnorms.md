RxNorms

RxNorm is a normalized naming system for generic and branded drugs.

In the [EHR Setup Window](ehrsetupwindow.html), click **RxNorms**.

Alternatively, RxNorms may be assigned to [Medications](medicationmaster.html) using a pick list **[...]**.

Drug names include active ingredients, strength, and form. All medications in the master list must have an RxNorm assigned for medication reconciliation, clinical decision support interventions, and Open Dental's drug interaction alerts to work correctly. This will also ensure a patient's medications show on clinical documents (e.g., [Continuity of Care Document (CCD)](ehrccd.html)).

To import RxNorms see [Importing Code Systems](codesystemimport.html).
