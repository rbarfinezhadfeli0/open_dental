Conversions: Overlapping Appointments

See [Use Converted Database](usingodconversion.html).

After a final [Conversion](../site/conversions.html), clean up appointments if the previous software allowed unassigned appointments. During the final conversion, any appointments that are not assigned to an operatory, are pushed into an Unassigned or Extra operatory. These appointments must be moved into the correct operatory.

To find these appointments: In [User Query Favorites](queryfavorites.html), double-click the *Conv - Future Appts by Operatory* query.

For each appointment identified, go to the [Appointments Module](appointments.html) and move the appointment to the correct operatory.

When all appointments in the Unassigned and Extra operatories have been moved, the operatory can be removed from the Appointments Module by hiding it in [Operatory Setup](operatories.html).
