Definitions: Claim Payment Groups

Create Claim Payment Groups to help organize entering claim payments.

In the [Main Menu](mainmenu.html), click Setup, [Definitions](definitions.html), Claim Payment Groups.

The Claim Payment Group definition determines the list of payment group options available when [Finalizing Insurance Payments](claimpayfinalize.html) or entering [Batch Insurance Payments](claimpaymentbatch.html). The *Default* item is added and hidden by default. Add Claim Payment Groups as needed.

Payment groups are useful for large enterprise organizations who have multiple people entering payments at once to prevent overlapping effort. The Daily Payments report can be filtered by claim payment group to track the work of different employees or departments.

Double-click an existing item or click **Add** to create a new item. The Edit Definition window opens.

**Name**: Enter the group name. A dropdown menu appears with group names in the [Edit Insurance Payment](claimpayfinalize.html) window.

**Hidden**: Mark the group name as hidden.

Note: Once the Default item is unhidden or additional Claim Payment groups are added, the Claim Payment Group dropdown is always visible in the Edit Insurance Payment window, and at least one Claim Payment Group must be visible (i.e., not marked *Hidden*).

Click **Save** to exit the window and keep changes.
