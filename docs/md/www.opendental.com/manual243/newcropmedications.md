NewCrop eRx Medications

In the [Ensora eRx (formerly NewCrop eRx) / Prescription](newcrop.html) interface, at the bottom, is an Active Medications area.

Ensora eRx uses the medications entered here when doing [Drug Interaction Checks](newcropdruginteraction.html). When a user writes and transmits an electronic prescription, the medication is automatically listed here. However, medications entered directly in Open Dental are not currently passed to Ensora eRx; users must manually enter them.

To add a medication to the *Active Medications* list:

1. Click the **Med Entry** tab at the top of the Ensora Rx window.
2. If needed, enter in *Outside Prescriber* name and *Original Date* for the medication.
3. Enter the first few characters of the drug name and click **Drug Search**.

6. (optional) To enter more details about the medication (e.g., Sig), click **Edit**. Some information cannot be edited once the medication has been added to the patient's active medications. Click **Queue Rx** once information has been entered.
7. The medication has been added to the *Pending Medications* list. Check the box next to the medication and click **Record** to move the medication to the patient's *Active Medications*.

The medication is added to the Current Medications list with an ![](images/newCropMedEntryIcon.png) icon to indicate it was added via the Med Entry tab. The medication is also added to the patient's active medications in Open Dental.

## Discontinued Medications

If a patient is no longer taking a medication listed in the *Active Medications* list, it can be marked discontinued.

To discontinue an Active Medication:

1. Click the Edit dropdown on an active medication.
2. Click **Discontinue**.
The medication is moved to the *Discontinued Medications* list. The medication is also marked discontinued in Open Dental when the Chart Module is refreshed (a *Stop Date* is entered). To change a current medication, click **Edit**.
