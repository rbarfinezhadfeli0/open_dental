Web Sched Recall: What Patient Sees

Below is a description of what the patient sees when they receive a [Web Sched Recall](webschedrecallsetup.html) notification.

1. The patient receives a notification to schedule their appointment. One notification for each recall appointment is sent to the patient's [Authorized Representatives](authrep.html). Each reminder contains a clickable link that is patient-specific based on patient number.

2. When the link is clicked, Web Sched Recall opens in a browser.

   * **Select a Provider**: If patients are allowed to select a provider, and more than one provider has available openings, the patient can select a provider from the dropdown.
   * **Calendar**: By default, the first dates with available time slots show, based on criteria selected in [Web Sched Recall](webschedrecallsetup.html). Select a date and available appointment times show. Select the desired appointment time.
   * **Notify me if an earlier appointment time becomes available**: (optional) Check to have the office notify patient about earlier appointments. This marks the appointment as ASAP and shows on the ASAP List.
3. Click **Finalize Appt**.
4. A confirmation message shows. To confirm, click **Yes**. To return to the list of available dates, click **No**.

## In Open Dental

* Scheduled appointments instantly show up in the [Appointments Module](appointments.html).
* [Alerts](alerts.html) are created to notify staff a Web Sched Recall appointment has been scheduled.
* Use the [Web Sched Appointments Report](webschedapptreport.html) to view and track appointments scheduled using Web Sched.

Note: Once an appointment is scheduled it cannot be changed in Web Sched Recall. If a patient reopens the email link, they are notified an appointment has already been booked.
