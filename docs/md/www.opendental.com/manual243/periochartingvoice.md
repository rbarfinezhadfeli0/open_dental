Voice Perio Charting

Use Voice Perio Charting to record perio exams hands free.

In the [Perio Chart](perio.html), click the **microphone icon** to start recording.

The chart can be recorded via voice commands in English, using Universal Tooth Numbering. A microphone must be set up on the computer. Any microphone or headset recognized by Windows will work.

Note: Open Dental Cloud users are not able to utilize Voice Perio Charting.

Use the following list of voice commands when voice charting. These are the only prompts Open Dental will recognize.

Adding Exams:

* ***Add perio exam***: Add a new exam.
* ***New perio exam***: Add a new exam.
* ***Copy previous exam***: Copy the previous exam.

Navigating the Perio Chart:

* ***Stop Listening***: Pause listening. Use to pause listening without ending recording completely.
* ***Start Listening***: Start the listening. Used to resume listening after having paused it.
* ***Start giving feedback***: Turn system back to repeat measurements.
* ***Stop giving feedback***: Turn off system from repeating measurements.
* ***Left***: Move cursor left.
* ***Right***: Move cursor right.
* ***Delete***: Delete selected item.
* ***Backspace***: Move cursor back a space and clears the newly selected cell.

## Recommendations

When considering which headset to purchase, choose one with good noise cancellation built-in to filter out background noise. Keep in mind that a noisy environment or improper microphone setting on the computer will result in less reliable voice recognition.

The following headsets have been tested by Open Dental and have worked well for us.

* Logitech H390 wired headset
* Jabra EVOLVE 65
* Logitech H800 Bluetooth Wireless headset

## Voice controlled charting using other programs

Perio charting can also be controlled by voice using third party programs. Below are known solutions.

## Troubleshooting

**Error: Unable to initialize audio input. Try plugging a different microphone into the computer.**

Solution: No microphone was recognized by the computer. Check Windows microphone settings.

**Error: When trying to chart Furcation, Gingival Margin, Mobility, or Mucogingival Junction, Open Dental goes back to the previous site.**

Solution: No probing depth has been entered on the site you are attempting to chart Furcation, Gingival Margin, Mobility, or Mucogingival Junction. A probing depth must be entered before these can be charted when utilizing voice perio charting.
