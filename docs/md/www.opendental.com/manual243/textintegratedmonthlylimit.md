SMS Warning Amount

Set an SMS Warning Amount, that if reached prevents users from sending additional manual text messages.

In [eServices Signup Basic](signupportalbasic.html), at the top, is the SMS Warning area.

**SMS Warning Amount**: Enter a warning amount, per clinic. The Warning Amount is an estimate of how much each location (clinic) would like to spend on outgoing text messages per month.

* Once the amount is reached for the month for the clinic, users cannot manually send text messages until the amount is increased or a new billing cycle begins.
* If the practice is on support, use Save at the bottom to save changes. If the practice is not on support, use the **Save SMS Limit** to update the limit.
* The SMS Warning Amount does not apply to or stop automated eReminders, eConfirmations, Web Sched Recall, or Web Sched ASAP text messages.
* If $20 is entered as the the amount and there are three clinics, each clinic has an individual amount of $20, but the total amount equals $60.
