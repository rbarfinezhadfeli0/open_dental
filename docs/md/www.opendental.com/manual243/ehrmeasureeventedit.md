EHR Edit Measure Events

Measure events are actions a user takes that affect an [EHR](../site/ehrlicense.html) measure calculation. Measure event dates can be changed. All changes are tracked in an audit trail. You must have the EHR Measure Event Edit Permission. See [Permissions](permissions.html).

## Change a measure event date

To edit a measure event, select a patient.

1. In the [Chart Module](chart.html) toolbar, click EHR. The stage 1 or stage 2 [dashboard](ehrdashboard1.html) will show depending on your Meaningful Use stage.
