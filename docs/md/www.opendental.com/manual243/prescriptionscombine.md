Combine Prescriptions

In [Rx / Prescriptions List](rxsetup.html), at the bottom, is a **Combine** button.

Combining prescriptions is useful when multiple versions of the same prescription have been inadvertently created. Combining prescriptions does not change the historical information of prescriptions that are already in patient charts.

Select the prescriptions you want to combine (press Ctrl or SHIFT while clicking).

Click Combine.
