EHR Amendments

Amendments are a way to document and track provider, organization, or patient provided information in the patient's EHR record. You can scan documents or only document a file's location. Scanned amendments do not show in the patient's chart, in the Images module, or anywhere else.

On the [EHR Dashboard](ehrdashboard1.html), click Amendments.
