Inmediata Health Group offers a clearinghouse as well as other services.

## Setup

Default settings are preset in this window. Verify settings before sending claims.

## Technical Details

Use the IMPlug software provided by Inmediata to securely upload the claim files created by Open Dental.

In the IMPlug software, find the Integration Settings tab. Create the Reports folder and the Claims folder in the process.

Do not put anything in the Outbound History box because Open Dental already keeps a history in Claims\Archive.

## Electronic EOBS (ERA 835)

Import of [ERAs](claimsera835.html) is fairly automated. The Inmediata *Inbound* path should be set the same as the *Report Path* on the Edit Clearinghouse window. Then the 835s should import automatically each time a claim is sent, or manually when *Get Reports* is clicked on the Insurance Claims window.
