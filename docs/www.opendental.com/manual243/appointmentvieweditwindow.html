<img src="images/apptViewEdit.png" width="915" height="712"/><h2>Options</h2>
<img src="images/apptViewOptions.png" width="551" height="154"/><p class="MarginBottomZero"></p>
<ul class="MarginBottomGap">
<li><b>Description</b>: The identifying name of this Appointment View.</li>
<li><b>Rows per time increment (usually 1)</b>: Affects the row height for time increments. Enter a number between 1 and 3.</li>
<li><b>Minimum Op width (default 0) (turns on hscroll)</b>: Enter the minimum width of an operatory (in pixels). Appointments do not scale down below that width, and a horizontal scroll bar appears at the bottom if needed.</li>
<li><b>View Start Time on Load</b>: Set a fixed default start time. This option is only used when start times are not determined dynamically.</li>
<li><b>Dynamic start time based on schedule</b>: When checked, the schedule automatically scrolls to whichever comes first: the start time of the earliest appointment or blockout, or the scheduled start time of the earliest scheduled provider.  <ul>
<li>Only providers in operatories included in the view are considered.</li>
<li>Operatories not assigned a provider consider the default provider's <a href="schedule.html">Schedule</a>. </li>
<li>If no operatory has a scheduled provider or appointment, the <i>View Start Time on Load</i> value is used.</li>
<li>When Open Dental is first launched, the appointment schedule automatically scrolls to the default start time based on the settings above. After Open Dental is launched, the scroll bar remembers the last position it was in and stays there when moving around the program. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Disable appointment bubbles</b>: Set whether or not the Appointment Bubble appears in this Appointment View when hovering over an appointment in the schedule. <ul>
<li>When checked, Appointment Bubbles do not appear when hovering over appointments.</li>
<li>When unchecked, Appointment Bubbles appear when hovering over appointments. </li>
<li>Disabling Appointment Bubbles is useful for privacy (so PHI is not visible) and can improve system performance. </li>
<li>The default state of this setting is determined by <i>Default appointment bubble to 'disabled' for new Appointment Views</i> in <a href="preferences.html">Preferences</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Clinic</b>: If using <a href="clinics.html">Clinics</a>, select the Clinic associated with this view. The view is only available when this Clinic is selected in the <a href="mainmenu.html">Main Menu</a>. Selecting <i>Unassigned</i> allows the view to be selected from <i>Headquarters</i>. Defaults to the Clinic selected on the Appointment Views window.</li>
<li><b>Waiting Room Name Format</b>: Set how name displays in the <a href="waitingroom.html">Waiting Room</a>.  <ul>
<li>Last, First: Displays patient's last and first name (e.g., Smith, John).</li>
<li>First, Last Initial: Displays patient's first name and last initial (e.g., John, S).</li>
<li>First: Displays patient's first name only (e.g., John).</li>

<li>Only operatories selected in <i>View Operatories</i> are considered.</li>
<li>For this feature to function correctly, it is recommended that all providers be scheduled in an operatory (<a href="schedule.html">Schedule Setup</a>).</li>
<li>If there is an operatory that does not have a provider scheduled, but there is a provider on the schedule assigned as the operatory's provider, the operatory is still displayed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 When <i>Only show ops for scheduled provs</i> is checked, the following additional options are available:  <li><b>Only if before time</b>: Show operatories for providers whose schedule starts and ends before this time.</li>
<li><b>Only if after time</b>: Show operatories for providers whose schedule starts and ends after this time.</li>
</ul>
<p class="MarginBottomZero"></p>
<ul class="MarginBottomGap">
</ul>
<p class="MarginBottomZero"><b>In Week View, only show days that have scheduled provs or appts</b>: When checked, days with no scheduled appointment or scheduled providers are hidden from the Appointment View when Week is selected. When unchecked, all days of the week (Monday - Sunday) are shown in Week view. </p>
<ul class="MarginBottomGap">
<li>Providers are considered scheduled if they have a schedule for the day and are the default provider for an operatory. Providers are also considered scheduled if they are assigned to an operatory in the schedule. See <a href="schedulesetupexamples.html">Schedule Setup Examples</a> for additional information.</li>
<li>Only provider schedules and appointments for the operatories in the view are considered.</li>
