<div class="TopBar2"><p>Claim Procedures ( claimprocs )</p></div>
<div class="GeneralPageContent">
<p>View and edit details of a procedure attached to an insurance claim or estimate from the Edit Claim Procedure window.</p>
<p>In a <a href="claimedit.html">Claim</a>, double-click on a procedure.</p>
<img src="images/claimProc.png" width="915" height="664"/><p>Alternatively, in the <a href="procedurefinancial.html">Procedure - Financial Tab</a> double-click an estimate.</p>
<p class="MarginBottomZero">A claim procedure (claimproc) is used for the following purposes: </p>
<ul class="MarginBottomGap">
<li>To attach procedures to claims.</li>
<li>To split insurance payments on claims.</li>
<li>To record total insurance payments on claims. These payments are not attached to procedures.</li>
<li>To store insurance estimates before a claim is created.</li>
</ul>
<p class="MarginBottomZero">In a typical situation: </p>
<ol class="MarginBottomGap">
<li>While treatment planning, a procedure is created.</li>
<li>A claimproc is automatically added to the procedure to keep track of its estimated insurance portion. Change the estimate by editing the claimproc.</li>
<li>When the claim for the procedure is created, the claimproc links the procedure to the claim.</li>
<li>When viewing the claim detail, all procedure estimates and payments are stored in the claimproc rather than with the procedure. This allows for an unlimited number of claims to be sent for each procedure and users to have very fine control over all estimates and payments for each claim.</li>
<li>When receiving a claim, it can be itemized by procedure or entered as a total payment.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Miscellaneous Information</h2>
<img src="images/claimProcMisc.png" width="440" height="208"/><p><b>Ins Plan</b>: Displays the insurance carrier and subscriber name. Claimprocs are always associated with one insurance plan whether they are an estimate or attached to a claim.</p>
<p class="MarginBottomZero"><b>Status</b>: The status of the claim procedure. </p>
<ul class="MarginBottomGap">
<li>Estimate: Not yet attached to a claim. Claim Info section is not shown. Estimates never affect the patient balance.</li>
<li>Not Received: Attached to a claim with a status other than <i>Received</i>.</li>
<li>Received: Attached to a claim with a <i>Received</i> status. Should also be attached to an insurance payment (finalized).</li>

<li>InsHist: Procedure was created by adding a date to <a href="inshistory.html">Insurance History</a>. </li>
<li>Supplemental: Indicates an additional payment on the same procedure. Estimates are generally 0. Almost identical to Received.</li>
<li>For <a href="plancapitation.html">Capitation ( HMO / DMO ) Insurance Plan</a>, the statuses below apply:  <ul>
<li>CapClaim: Since most capitation procedures are not sent to insurance there are always duplicate claimprocs for a procedure (similar to Supplemental). The first claimproc tracks the copay and write-off and is never attached to a claim (status is <i>CapComplete</i>). The second claimproc has a status of <i>CapClaim</i>.</li>
<li>CapEstimate: Not yet attached to a claim or for a procedure that is treatment planned (TP). When procedure is completed, status can be changed to <i>CapComplete</i> but never to anything else.</li>
<li>CapComplete: Only used when procedure is set complete. This stores the copay and write-off amounts. The copay is only there for reference; the write-off affects the balance. Never attached to a claim.</li>

This provider is assigned to any insurance payment. Click <b>[...]</b> to change. The provider can only be changed when the status is set to <i>Not Received</i>. See <a href="claimprocedureprovider.html">Claimproc Provider</a> for more details.</p>
<p><b>Clinic</b>: Only visible if the <a href="clinics.html">Clinics</a> feature is enabled in <a href="showfeatures.html">Show Features</a>. Normally the clinic assigned to the <a href="procedureedit.html">Procedure</a> (e.g., treating clinic), but it can differ. This affects some reports. </p>
<p><b>Pay Entry Date</b>: The date the related insurance payment was entered. Used to track account aging. Only displays after an insurance payment has been received.</p>
<p><b>Payment Date</b>: Can be edited until attached to an insurance check. Once attached to an insurance check, see <a href="claimpayfinalize.html">Finalize Insurance Payment</a> to edit payment information. </p>

<ul class="MarginBottomGap">
<li><b>Code Sent to Ins</b>: The procedure code sent to insurance. Usually, it is the same as the actual procedure code but may be different if using alternate codes (e.g., for Medicaid), medical codes, or custom codes with suffixes that get removed before being sent.</li>

<li>Normally, this is the same as the procedure amount billed to the patient, but it can differ. </li>
<li>If <i>Claims show UCR fee</i> is checked on the Edit Insurance Plan window, the amount defaults to the provider's UCR fee.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<img src="images/claimProcFeeInfo.png" width="299" height="68"/><p><b>Do Not Bill to Insurance</b>: Only used when the claimproc is an estimate. Indicates that this claimproc will remain an estimate and never be attached to a claim. Estimate information is hidden when this box is checked. This box is greyed out when the procedure is attached to a claim or preauthorization.</p>
<p><b>Fee</b>: The actual fee billed to the patient as entered on the <a href="procedureedit.html">Procedure</a>.</p>
<p><b>Fee Schedule</b>: The fee schedule of the insurance plan listed first in the Family Module. If this is a medical procedure code, this fee schedule may not accurately indicate where the fee is pulled from.</p>

<p class="MarginBottomZero"><b>Allowed Amt</b>: Insurance allowed fee (e.g., contracted fee). Frequently, insurance companies do not allow the full fee because they claim it is above UCR for the area. In these cases, enter the allowed fee that should be used for all calculations instead of the <i>Fee</i>.  </p>
<ul class="MarginBottomGap">
<li>Changes to the allowed amount can be made for this claim only by entering a fee into the white box.</li>
<li> If this is a PPO plan, an allowed amount may already be entered. Click <b>Edit Allowed Amt</b> to change the amount in the fee schedule. </li>
<li>When entering <a href="claimpayfinalize.html">Insurance Payments</a>, there is also a column for allowed amounts, and these flow into the out-of-network fee schedule if one is assigned to the insurance plan (Edit Insurance Plan window, Carrier Allowed Amount). </li>
<li>If using <a href="bluebooksetup.html">Blue Book</a>, see the Blue Book Log for details on how the fee is determined. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Estimate Information</h2>
<p>Changing information does not change the patient's balance. To update a patient's estimated balance and see updated estimates on a claim after making changes, click <b>Recalculate Estimates</b> in the Edit Claim window.</p>
<img src="images/claimProcInsEst.png" width="384" height="255"/><p class="MarginBottomZero"><b>Patient Copay</b>: For most plan types, based on the insurance plan's <i>Patient Co-pay Amounts</i> fee schedule. </p>
<ul class="MarginBottomGap">
<li>For capitation, this automates write-off calculation.</li>
<li>For any other insurance, this amount is subtracted from what insurance is expected to pay.</li>
</ul>
<p>For Fixed Benefit Plan Types, this Patient Copay is calculated as <span class="codeblock">(Fee or Allowed Amt) - Fixed Benefit Amount</span>. Fixed Benefit Amount is determined by the <i>Fixed Benefit</i> fee schedule assigned to the insurance plan. </p>
<p><b>Deductible</b>: Indicates any <a href="deductibles.html">Deductible</a> amount applied to the estimate. The patient must pay this amount before insurance coverage is applied. This affects the Insurance Estimate and Patient Portion.</p>
<p><b>Percentage %</b>: The percentage that insurance is expected to cover, based on a plan's benefits.</p>
<p><b>Paid By Other Ins</b>: Adds up all amounts paid by insurance plans that are lower in order. For example, it never contains an amount if this is primary insurance. Enable <i>Auto update secondary claim estimates when primary is received</i> in <a href="preferences.html">Preferences</a> to update this amount automatically.</p>
<p><b>BaseEst</b>: Base insurance estimate before considering any deductible or maximums (e.g., annual max). Calculated as <span class="codeblock">(Fee or Allowed) - Copay) x (Percentage or Percent Override)</span></p>

<li> It depends on the order of treatment in the Treatment Plan. </li>
<li>If the claimproc is already attached to a claim, this does not affect the patient balance The Insurance Estimate under Claim Info should be used instead. </li>

<p><b>Estimate Note</b>: Contains automatically generated notes about maximums, limitations, exclusions, etc. that may affect the insurance calculations and also display in the Treatment Plan.</p>
<p><div class="Note">Note: Overrides can be entered into the white boxes to the right of select fields. Entering overrides does not recalculate all estimates. For example, adding a missing <i>Percentage</i> does not result in a missing <i>Deductible</i> being added, and updating an <i>Allowed Amt</i> does not recalculate the <i>Write-off Estimate</i>. Whenever possible, it is best to correct coverage information on the <a href="insplan.html">Insurance Plan</a>.</div>
