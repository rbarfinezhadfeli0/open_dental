There are two reports specifically for Arizona.  They will become visible in the Reports window once the four fields below have been added by the user.

Arizona Primary Care Setup Requirements

* Add all of the required patient fields to Open Dental (names must match exactly). If you do not add these fields,
then the Arizona Primary Care reports will not be available to you. The patient field names are:
SPID#, Eligibility Status, Household Gross Income, Household % of Poverty.

	As defined by the Arizona Primary Care program documentation:

	* SPID# - The patient's Arizona Primary Care ID Number.

		"This number starts with six leading zeros and is combined with the first initial of the
		patient’s first name, first initial of the patient’s last name, a six digit date format for the
		patient’s date of birth, and a single letter indicating the sex of the patient.
		Example: = 000000 (leading 0s)
		Louise Apostle = LA
		May 23rd, 1947 = 052347 (no slashes)
		Female = F
		77
		SPID = 000000LA052347F
		If you have two patients who are same sex twins with the same initials, differentiate them
		by assigning a one (1) to one of them. Place the one in front of the first initial. Example:
		First Twin = 000000LA052347F
		Second Twin = 000001LA052347F"

	* Eligibility Status - 

		"This field indicates the patient’s eligibility status. The characters are assigned as follows:
		A = Eligible (good for 396 days, A is used for the first determination) (new patients)
		B = Eligible and applying for AHCCCS (45 day limit)
		C = No longer eligible
		D = Re-establishing eligibility"

	* Household Gross Income -
		
		"Please do not use dollar signs, decimals, or cents, because they will cause the encounter to
		fail. This number should be rounded to the nearest dollar. Example: The client has an
		annual income of $8,364.65 – This should keyed as: 0008365 The leading zeros complete
		the seven (7) digit number field."

		Open Dental will only consider numbers and decimals in this field. So keying $8,364.65
		will automatically become 0008365

	* Household % of Poverty - 

		"This number indicates where the client falls on the Federal Poverty Level. The maximum
		allowable number for this program is two hundred percent (200 %). This number needs to be
		exact and leading zeros are needed for those below 100 % to complete the field. Do not key
		the percentage sign in this field. Example: Range = 000 through 200"
	

* Define a payment type of 'NOAH' and accept the copayments for Arizona Primary Care patients using this payment type.
* Must have an insurance carrier named 'NOAH', and all the Arizona Primary Care patients must have insurance plans which are
attached to the 'NOAH' carrier.
* In the insurance plan for a NOAH patient, you must set the insurance plan termination date, also known as the Date of 
Eligibility Status in the Arizona Primary Care Program.
* For each clinic, a clinic object must exist in the database which contains a description that ends with an underscore
followed by the 5-digit Arizona Primary Care Site ID Number for that clinic. i.e. "ClinicName_12345".
* When an appointment is completed for an Arizona Primary Care patient, you must ensure that the clinic is set to the correct
clinic site for the work completed in that appointment, otherwise the arizona primary care reports may report the incorrect
Site ID Number.
* If the patient is employed, then they must be attached to an employer, so they will show up as employed on the reports.
* Each NOAH patient must have an insurance relationship of 'self'.
* Each provider must have their Physician's ID placed into the provider State Licence Number field. This number is provided by
the Arizona state BOMEX system.

*Please note: Only certain procedures are billable to the Arizona Primary Care Program. As a result, when running the 
encounter report, only encounters/appointments attached to billable procedures will show up. The following procedures are currently
billable to the Arizona Primary Care Program:
