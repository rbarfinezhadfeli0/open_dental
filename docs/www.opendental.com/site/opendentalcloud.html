<p>Open Dental Cloud is a hosted solution managed by Open Dental Software.</p>
<img src="images/ODCloud.png" width="900" height="300"/><p>Open Dental Cloud looks and feels just like our local version, but can be accessed using a browser. To see if Open Dental Cloud is right for your office, give us a call. Our team will reach out to discuss the next steps.</p>
<p><div class="Note">Note: Open Dental Cloud is only available for US customers. The service is currently in limited release. We accept a limited number of customers requesting the service and give preference to those whose situation is a good match. There are some limitations on interoperability with third-party solutions.</div>
</p>
<br><p>The total monthly cost for Open Dental Cloud varies depending on the needs of the practice. An official quote will be provided before signup. </p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p><b>How is cloud data protected?</b></p>
<p>Each customer's database and A to Z folder (where documents and images are stored) are backed up periodically. The backups are encrypted, tested for integrity nightly, and stored off-site. See <a href="opendentalcloudbackups.html">Open Dental Cloud Backups</a> for more information.</p>
<p><b>What happens in the unlikely event of an Open Dental Cloud server failure?</b></p>
<p>In the event that the Open Dental Cloud server fails, the most recent backup will be restored to a new server by Open Dental staff.</p>
