<p>Measure 1: More than 50% of all unique patients seen by the provider during the reporting period are granted access to the Patient Portal within four business days so they can view online, download, or transmit their health information. This measure requires setting up the Patient Portal.</p>
<p>Measure 2: More than 5% of patients seen by the provider during the reporting period (or authorized representative) view, download, or transmit to a third party his/her health information during the reporting period.</p>
<p><b>Exclusions Available?</b></p>
<p>Yes, but unlikely dentists will qualify</p>

<h2>Calculations</h2>
<p class="MarginBottomZero">ElectronicCopyAccess (measure 1): </p>
<ul class="MarginBottomGap">
<li>Denominator: All unique patients with at least one completed procedure by the provider during the reporting period.</li>
<li>Numerator: Patients in the denominator who were granted access to the patient portal within 4 business days of their first completed procedure of the reporting period (or anytime prior to the first completed procedure).</li>
</ul>
<p class="MarginBottomZero">ElectronicCopy (measure 2): </p>
<ul class="MarginBottomGap">
<li>Denominator: All unique patients with at least one completed procedure by the provider during the reporting period.</li>
<li>Numerator: Patients in the denominator who have viewed online, downloaded, or transmitted to a third party their health information. They must do so after the first completed procedure date and during the reporting period.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>Set up the <a href="patientportal.html">Patient Portal Feature</a>. You can set up the portal yourself using our instructions or contact Open Dental to schedule a setup appointment.</p>
<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p><a href="../autoLogin.aspx%EF%B9%96ReturnUrl=%EA%A4%B7help253%EA%A4%B7authrep.html">Authorized Representatives</a></p>
<p>Workflow Recommendation: To ensure patients are counted towards the ElectronicCopy measure, we recommend setting up a location in your office where patients can log-in to the portal right after you grant access. This can work as a training tool so you can verify patients know how to log in, and patients can ask questions. While in your office, have the patient view or download their patient record.</p>
