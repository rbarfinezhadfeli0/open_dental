<h2>Claim Status, Claim Type, and Dates</h2>
<img src="images/claimStatusDate.png" width="236" height="130"/><p class="MarginBottomZero"><b>Claim Status</b>: Every claim has a status. </p>
<ul class="MarginBottomGap">
<li><b>Unsent</b>: Claim has been created, but not sent.</li>
<li><b>Hold until Pri received</b>: For secondary claims that should not be sent until the primary claim is received.</li>
<li><b>Waiting to Send</b>: Claim is ready to be printed or sent electronically. See <a href="claimsend.html">Send Claims</a>.</li>
<li><b>Probably Sent</b>: Claim has been printed or sent electronically, but the process has not yet been verified. As soon as it is verified the claim has been sent or printed, change the status.</li>
<li><b>Sent - Verified</b>: Claim has been sent or printed. Shows on the <a href="reportoutins.html">Outstanding Insurance Claims Report</a>, so it can be tracked to ensure timely payment.</li>
<li><b>Received</b>: Claim has been received from insurance, either with a payment or a denial. Usually, the claim is marked received automatically when clicking one of the Enter Payment buttons at the upper right.</li>
<li><b>Hold for In Process</b>: One or more procedures on the claim are set to <i>Complete (In Process)</i>. This status cannot be selected manually. Once all procedures in the group are set complete, the claim status is automatically updated to <i>Waiting to Send</i>. This claim status cannot be changed manually. See <a href="procsmultipleappts.html">Procedure over Multiple Appointments</a> for additional information.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a claim is created using the <b>New Claim</b> button for a patient with dual or triple coverage, the primary, secondary, and tertiary claims are automatically created. Primary claims have a status of <i>Waiting to Send</i>. Secondary claims have a status of <i>Hold until Pri received</i>. Tertiary claims have a status of <i>Unsent</i>. Once the primary claim is received, send the secondary claim. Send the tertiary claim after receiving the secondary claim. Claims that have not been marked sent can be tracked using the <a href="reportclaimsnotsent.html">Claims Not Sent Report</a>.</p>
<p><div class="Note">Note: <ul>
<li>For information about secondary claims, see <a href="inssecondary.html">Secondary Insurance</a>.</li>
<li>Claim text color is dependent on settings in <a href="definitionsaccountcolors.html">Definitions: Account Colors</a>.</li>
<li>Printing a claim with a status of <i>Unsent</i> or <i>Waiting to Send</i> automatically changes its status to <i>Sent - Verified</i>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</p>
<p><b>Claim Type</b>: Set automatically when creating a claim. It is there for reference, but cannot be changed, because it affects so many other fields. See <a href="claimtypes.html">Claim Types</a>.</p>
<p><b>Date of Service</b>: Defaults to the date of the last procedure listed on the claim.</p>
<p><b>Date Orig Sent</b>: The date the claim was originally sent.</p>

<p><b>Date Received</b>: The date the claim was received and processed.</p>
<p class="MarginBottomZero"><b>Resend</b>: Resend a claim electronically. There are two options: </p>
<ul>
<li><b>The claim has not been accepted yet and I need to resend it</b>: Claim Correction Type (<a href="claimtabmisc.html">Edit Claim - Misc Tab</a>) is set to <i>Original</i> and Date Resent is set to today's date. </li>
<li><b>The claim was accepted and I need to replace it with updated information</b>: Correction Type is set to <i>Replacement</i>. </li>
</ul>
<p class="MarginBottomGap">Click <b>Send</b> after selecting an option to finish resending claim.</p>

<p><b>Med/Dent</b>: There are three options; Dental, Medical, and Institutional. The default selection is based on the Claim Type. This setting is used for e-claims and determines whether the e-claim format is Dental, Medical, or Institutional.</p>
<p><b>Claim Form</b>: The <a href="claimforms.html">Claim Form</a> used when printing the claim. This does not affect what is sent electronically. For information on how a printed 1500 claim form is populated, see <a href="claimform1500.html">HCFA 1500 Claim Form</a>. For information on how printed ADA claim forms are populated, see <a href="claimformADA2012.html">ADA Claim Forms</a>. </p>
<p class="MarginBottomZero"><b>Billing Provider</b>: Billing provider who is sent or printed on the claim. The default billing provider follows the logic below. </p>
<ul class="MarginBottomGap">
<li>If the treating provider has a Claim Billing Prov Override, that provider is used (<a href="providerseditwindow.html">Provider</a>).</li>
<li>Otherwise, for clinics, if the procedure is assigned to a clinic, the Default Insurance Billing Dentist for that clinic is used (<a href="clinicsetup.html">Clinic List</a>).</li>
<li>Otherwise, the Default Insurance Billing Dentist for the practice is used (<a href="practice.html">Practice Setup</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p class="MarginBottomZero"><b>Treating Provider</b>: Treating provider who is sent or printed on the claim.  </p>
<ul class="MarginBottomGap">
<li>By default, is the last provider in the list of selected procedures who is not flagged as a secondary provider. If there are only providers flagged as a secondary provider, then the patient's primary provider is used. Some claim formats require a Treating Provider. Different providers can still be assigned to each procedure. When providers are restricted to specific Clinics, only providers available for the claim's Clinic are options.</li>
</ul>
<p class="MarginBottomZero"><b>Predeterm Benefits</b>: If a <a href="preauth.html">Preauthorization</a> has previously been sent, enter reference number for the preauthorization received from insurance. </p>
<ul class="MarginBottomGap">
<li>This may be <i>Claim Identifier (CLM01)</i> value from the <a href="claimtabmisc.html">Edit Claim - Misc Tab</a> of the Preauthorization. Verify with the carrier what value/identifier to use for the preauthorization. </li>
<li>This number shows on e-claims and printed claims (PreAuthString).</li>
<li>On the Claim Misc tab, there is also a <i>Prior Authorization (rare)</i> field.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Insurance Plans</h2>
<img src="images/claimInsurancePlans.png" width="277" height="164"/><p><b>Insurance Plan</b>: Set when creating the claim and cannot be changed. If the claim is attached to the wrong insurance plan, delete the claim and recreate it.</p>
<p><b>Relationship</b>: The patient's relationship to the plan's subscriber, based on the value set in the patient's Edit Insurance Plan Window.</p>
<p class="MarginBottomZero"><b>Other Coverage</b>: This automatically populates for primary, secondary, and tertiary dental claims. </p>
<ul>
<li> Primary dental claims populate the secondary plan information.</li>
<li>Secondary claims populate the secondary plan information.</li>
<li>Tertiary claims populate the secondary plan information.</li>
</ul>
<p class="MarginBottomGap"> Click <b>Change</b> to select a different plan or display coverage on claims for other plan types (i.e., Medical or Other). Click <b>None</b> to remove this information from the claim.</p>

<h2>Procedures and Estimates</h2>
<img src="images/claimProcedures.png" width="915" height="185"/><p class="MarginBottomZero"><b>Procedures</b>: The procedures attached to this claim, along with billed fees and insurance estimate information.

<ul class="MarginBottomGap">
<li><b>Add adjustment</b>: Right-click on a procedure to create an adjustment. The preference, <i>Allow procedure adjustments from claim window</i>, must be enabled.</li>
<li><b>#</b>: The number of the procedure as ordered in the claim. Procedures are sorted in the following order: <ol>

<li>Tooth number (no tooth number first, then lowest to highest)</li>
<li>Date (oldest to newest)</li>
 If multiple codes have the same priority, tooth number, and date then the order is random. It may be in the order charted but it may not. The order could even change. </ol>
</li>

Displays the patient responsibility for a line item once an insurance payment is made (Fee - Ins Pay - Write-off = Pat Resp). This column does not consider numbers in the Ins Est field. Supplemental payments may show a negative patient responsibility as the fee is not duplicated on supplemental claimprocs.</li>
<li><b>Status</b>: Current claim status of the claim procedure, e.g.,: Recd (Received), Supp (Supplemental), etc.</li>
<li><b>Pmt</b>: Payment. An "X" indicates a finalized payment has been entered for the procedure.</li>

</ul>
<p class="MarginBottomZero"><b>Recalculate Estimates</b>: Recalculate benefit estimates. For example:  </p>
<ul class="MarginBottomGap">
<li>If procedures are treatment planned with the wrong percentages and a claim is created before fixing the percentages, estimates can be recalculated instead of deleting the claim.</li>
<li>If a fee schedule was originally incorrect, recalculate write-offs.</li>
<li>The fee billed updates on claims that have not been sent or received.</li>
</ul>
<div class="Note">Note: An orange exclamation mark appears next to the button when recalculation of claim estimates is suggested.</div>
<br/><br/><p>Medical claims: The Ins Est column can be misleading if the patient has one dental insurance plan listed first and one <a href="medicalins.html">Medical Insurance</a> plan listed second. In this particular situation, the Ins Est column always indicates 0, because it is showing the dental insurance estimates. To avoid this issue, ensure that the medical plan is listed first in the Family Module. </p>
<p class="MarginBottomZero">There are limits to the number of procedures that are sent with a claim.  </p>
<ul class="MarginBottomGap">
<li>Dental and medical e-claims are limited to 50 procedures. Claims with more than 50 procedures are blocked from sending.</li>
<li>Institutional e-claims are limited to 999 procedures. A separate claim must be created for additional procedures.</li>
