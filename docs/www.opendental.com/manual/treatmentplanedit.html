<div class="GeneralPageContent">
<p>In the <a href="treatmentplan.html">Treatment Plan Module</a>, double-click any of the inactive, active, or saved Treatment Plans to edit.</p>
<img src="images/treatEdit.png" width="527" height="159"/><p>There are multiple types of treatment plans, each with their own designated usage. </p>
<h2>Saved Treatment Plans</h2>
<p>Saved Treatment Plans are designed to track treatment the patient has accepted. It can track acceptance rate and retains the fee information for the date it was saved. Saved treatment plans can also be used as one way to display treatment options (e.g. bridge vs implant).</p>
<p class="MarginBottomZero">To save a treatment plan: </p>
<ol class="MarginBottomGap">
<li>In the Treatment Plan, highlight the accepted procedures or treatment options, then click <b>Save TP</b>. </li>
<li>If <i>Prompt to save Treatment Plans</i> is checked in Preferences, a popup will appear to rename the Saved Treatment Plan. Rename as needed.</li>
<li>Once saved, the Saved Treatment Plan will appear at the top of the Treatment Plan Module with a status of <i>Saved</i>. <ul>
<li>Saved treatment plans can be viewed or printed anytime.</li>
<li>Procedure fees within a Saved Treatment Plan are not affected by the Update Fees tool. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Double-click a Saved Treatment Plan to edit the date, heading, note, responsible party, and presenter information. Once a saved plan is electronically signed, it cannot be edited unless the signature is cleared.</p>
<img src="images/tpEdit.png" width="662" height="447"/><p class="MarginBottomZero">Modify the information as needed: </p>
<ul class="MarginBottomGap">
<li><b>Date</b>: The date of the treatment plan.</li>
<li><b>Note</b>: The note that typically appears at the bottom of the treatment plan. Set the<i> Default Note</i> in Preferences. This text box supports <a href="rightclicktextboxes.html">Right-Click Options</a>.</li>
<li><b>Responsible Party</b>: Only visible if <a href="publichealth.html">Public Health</a> is turned on in <a href="showfeatures.html">Show Features</a>. Click Pick to select the person, other than the patient or guarantor, who is responsible for approving the treatment plan. Click <b>X</b> to clear a name.</li>
<li><b>Saved Document</b>: Only displays when the treatment plan has been signed and saved as a PDF. Click <b>View </b>to open the treatment plan. To always save treatment plans as PDF files, enable the preference, <i>Save Signed Treatment Plans to PDF</i>. When treatment plans are saved as PDF, they are automatically named. Users can rename the file from the <a href="images.html">Imaging Module</a>.</li>
<li><b>Presenter</b>: The user who presented the treatment plan. Defaults to the logged-on user. Click [...] to select a different presenter. Presenter options include all users, or, users who are associated with the clinic.</li>
<li><b>User Entry</b>: The user logged on when the treatment plan was saved. Cannot be changed.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>: Click to delete the Saved Treatment Plan. </li>
<li><b>Clear Signature</b>: Click to clear the signature. Once cleared, edits can be made. </li>
</ul>
<p>When a treatment plan is saved, edits can be made to individual procedures as needed without affecting the original procedure. Select a Saved Treatment Plan, then double-click a procedure. </p>

Procedures remain in the same order as they were when saved. </p>
<h2>Active/Inactive Plans</h2>
<p>An Active Treatment Plan displays treatment charted for the patient that has not been completed. Use Inactive Treatment Plans to keep a record of treatment the patient denied. Inactive Treatment Plans are also another way to present treatment options to a patient (e.g. bridge vs implant).</p>
<p class="MarginBottomZero">To inactivate procedures (denied treatment): </p>
