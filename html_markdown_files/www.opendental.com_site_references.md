<p>If you would like to speak with a current Open Dental user prior to purchasing Open Dental, please contact us for a reference. We will attempt to find a couple references for you to contact. Often we can narrow references to users in your geographic area, or to users who share your specialty or are of a similar size (e.g., multiple locations). </p>
<p>We do not contact offices to let them know we have supplied them as a reference. Please understand that they may be busy and explain you are calling to talk about their experience using Open Dental. </p>
<p>We choose offices who are currently on Open Dental support, and usually those who have used Open Dental for a longer period of time. If you would like to opt out of being a possible reference, please let us know.</p>
<p><b>Reference Guidelines</b><br></p>
<ul>
<li>We do not supply references for third party software or services (e.g., digital imaging, clearinghouses, bridges, etc.).</li>
<li> We do not track 'public health' offices so cannot provide a public health reference.</li>
<li> We do not give references to non-dentists.</li>
</ul>
