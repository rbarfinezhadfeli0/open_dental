<p>When Open Dental receives negative reports about third-party companies, we sometimes must issue a warning. See below for a list of warnings issued.</p>
<p><b>10/24/2024 </b>- Modento <br> Modento concerns have been addressed and resolved. </p>
<p><b>08/08/2024</b> - NexHealth <br> We specifically advise customers not to use NexHealth products that claim to integrate with Open Dental. If you do, you are likely bypassing Open Dental security, and the data that they may hack into the Open Dental database can cause unhandled exceptions. We are making this announcement as this has happened and will likely happen again in the future, (three customers as of August 8, 2024) and Open Dental may not be able to fix your issues because we do not have a record of the methods NexHealth may be employing to insert data into Open Dental.</p>
<p><b>07/26/2024</b> - Adit<br>  We have received a report of representatives calling Open Dental customers claiming to be from Open Dental or partnered with Open Dental. Adit is not affiliated with Open Dental in any way and we would not ask them to call you. This service writes back unauthorized data to the Open Dental database which is dangerous.<br> Open Dental is advising practices not to use Adit. If you received a call from Adit representative using any of these deceptive sales techniques, please report it to Open Dental Support immediately.</p>
<p><b>02/22/2024</b> - Retrace Dental and Retrace Labs<br> Retrace Dental concerns have been addressed and resolved. </p>
<p><b>01/18/2024</b> - Weave<br> Weave concerns have been addressed and resolved.</p>
<h2>Dangerous/Unknown Vendors</h2><p>These vendors are using a possibly dangerous integration type. These types of integrations are dangerous because the third party writes directly to the Open Dental database, versus writing via the API which uses Open Dental code. Alternatively, these vendors may be using a plug-in that has not been whitelisted by Open Dental. These vendors should be avoided as they can harm your data, including patient data, and are not guaranteed to work as Open Dental releases new versions. These vendors can contact Open Dental for information on safe integrations or to be removed from this list if they are not writing to the Open Dental database.</p>
<p>If you believe a product is dangerous or not authorized, please email vendor.relations@opendental.com with details so that we may investigate.</p>
