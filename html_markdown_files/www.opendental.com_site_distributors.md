<p>Prior to Version 24.4, Open Dental had an open source GPL license that allowed other companies to package, sell, and support the software on their own. This is no longer possible with newer versions. We're not really sure what those other companies will do moving forward. At least for a while, we expect that they will continue to support Version 24.3, the last available GPL version.</p>
