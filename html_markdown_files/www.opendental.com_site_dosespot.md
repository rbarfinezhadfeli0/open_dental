			<h1>DoseSpot eRx Feature</h1>
		</div>
		<div id="Content">
<p>DoseSpot is a method of sending electronic prescriptions in Open Dental. It is an internet based, secure ePrescribing system. DoseSpot integrates with Open Dental using a program link. It is only available in the United States and its territories.</p>
<p><img src="images/vendorDoseSpotHeader.png" width="900" height="300"/></p>
<h2>Features</h2><ul>
<li>Intuitive UI that is easy to use.</li>
<li>Comprehensive drug database including medication synchronization, prescriber monographs, and patient education leaflets.</li>
<li>Notifications for pending prescriptions and refills for the logged-on provider. </li>
<li>DoseSpot Connect allows patients to receive coupons via text message for prescribed medications.</li>
<li>Surescripts and Electronic Prescriptions for Controlled Substances (EPCS) certified. </li>
</ul>
<p>Contact Open Dental Support to register. The registration process can take up to ten business days to complete. When DoseSpot is enabled, the eRx button in Open Dental shows notifications for needed actions by the prescriber. <br><br><b>Practices new to ePrescribing: </b>Enable DoseSpot and begin sending ePrescriptions. <b><br> Practices already using eRx: </b>Practices using Ensora eRx (formerly NewCrop eRx) can choose to switch to DoseSpot or continue using Ensora eRx.</p>
<h2>Requirements </h2><p class="MarginBottomZero"></p>
<ul class="MarginBottomGap">
<li>Open Dental Version 24.2.51 or greater. The latest stable version is recommended.</li>
<li>A high-speed internet connection.</li>
<li>Microsoft Edge.</li>
<li>A valid Open Dental registration key. The key must be active (currently on support) to enable the DoseSpot integration.</li>
<li>The Open Dental eConnector must be installed.</li>
<li>Computers used for e-Prescribing must be using Windows Version 10 or greater, or Server 2016 or greater. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Cost</h2><p>For pricing, see <a href="fees.html">Fees for Support and Services</a>, Electronic Prescriptions. </p>
<p><span class="redtext">eRx fees are non-refundable once charges are initiated for the service month.</span> eRx fees cannot be refunded by Open Dental as the companies providing the background services charge for access, not usage. </p>
<p>Ensure only office staff with the authority to initiate charges are registering new providers for eRx. If a provider leaves your practice, you must cancel the eRx service for the provider to prevent future non-refundable charges. Neither Open Dental Staff nor Management can remove or refund charges once they have been incurred.</p>
<h2>Setup</h2><p class="MarginBottomZero">DoseSpot Setup has four main parts, each with multiple steps. You must call Open Dental support to activate the service. <br></p>
<ol class="MarginBottomGap">
<li>Enable DoseSpot program link.</li>
<li>Sign up for DoseSpot. See <a href="https://opendentalsoft.com:1943/ODDoseSpotRegistration/DoseSpotRegistration.aspx">DoseSpot Registration Form</a>.</li>
<li>Enable non-doctors.</li>
<li>Complete Identity Proofing. </li>
</ol>

<p>DoseSpot is available in <a href="mobileapp.html">ODMobile</a> and <a href="odtouch.html">ODTouch</a>. </p>
<p><b>Practices Switching to Open Dental</b><br>  A stand-alone version is available for providers who are planning to switch to Open Dental, but need electronic prescriptions available to them sooner due to new regulations. DoseSpot has a stand-alone product that you can use in the meantime, and if you sign up through Open Dental it will not be a separate contract. When you go live with Open Dental you will use an integrated product instead for new prescriptions. The two systems are distinct and data will not transfer, but you can continue to look in the stand-alone product for the older eRx data as needed. To sign up for the stand-alone product through Open Dental, call us or email <a href="mailto:eRx@opendental.com">eRx@opendental.com</a>. The signup process may be a little slower, because it is not automated but requires you to call us and for us to work with you.</p>
